Our Strategy

Banking – but fairer,
more rewarding, and
for the good
of society.

Nationwide holds a unique position in UK financial
services. As the largest building society, we can
deliver the valuable banking products and services
and mutual good to our customers that others cannot.

We have four strategic drivers. We focus
our time and money on them, so that we
can fulfil our purpose:

As a building society, we are owned by our members
– our customers who have their current account,
mortgage or savings with us.

•

We aim to return additional value to our members as
owners, through our Nationwide Fairer Share products
and payments.

•

As a modern mutual, we make a positive
difference for our members and customers,
our communities and society as a whole.

We deliver our valuable banking products and services
to all of our customers by helping them with:
managing everyday finances – one in ten1 of
the UK’s current accounts are with us and one
in five current account switchers came to us
last year2
owning a home – we are the UK’s second
largest mortgage provider
saving for the future – we look after almost
£1 in every £10 saved in the UK

We also support landlords and those who rely on
the private rented sector for their long-term housing
needs through our buy to let business, The Mortgage
Works. This diversifies our income, and helps us give
value back to our customers, through better product
pricing and service.
In total, around 75% of our funding comes from our
customers, and over 95% of our lending is secured on
residential property3.

As a mutual, our members – customers who have their
current account, mortgage or savings with us – are
our owners and are our primary stakeholders. We also
have other important stakeholders who we engage
with and consider in our decision making.

As a mutual, we are owned by our members, which means we think about profit in a different way from our
banking peers. We do not have to pursue profit to pay shareholders dividends. Instead, we balance our need to
retain sufficient profit to remain financially strong, with rewarding members and our commitment to share our
success through:

Delivering value in banking and rewarding loyalty.

Providing brilliant and trusted service.

Product and service propositions that meet the needs
and expectations of existing and future customers.

Committing at least 1% of our pre-tax profits4 each
year to charitable activities.

We are committed to maintaining effective
communications and building positive relationships
with all our stakeholders. More information on our
engagement with stakeholders can be found on
page 29.

Chairman’s Letter

Other information

Dear fellow
member
I am pleased to write to you
following my first full year of
service as your Chairman.
When I wrote to you last year,
we were all continuing to
adapt to living within a global
pandemic and the challenges
which that brought us. Last
year saw more change
and new challenges, yet
throughout that Nationwide
has continued to focus on its
members by continuing to
protect its financial strength.
Financially, our pre-tax profit
is 40% higher than last year
at £2.2 billion. This is after
delivering member financial
benefit of £1.1 billion, broadly
representing the amount by
which our members benefit
more than they would if
they banked with a typical
competitor.

In addition, our financial
strength has enabled
the Board to declare our
Nationwide Fairer Share
Payment – with eligible
members to receive a £100
payment into their current
account in June 2023 – and
the Nationwide Fairer Share
Bond. The Fairer Share
Payment will amount to an
estimated £340 million in total.
More details on eligibility can
be found at nationwide.co.uk/
fairershare. Only a mutual can
reward its members in this
way. In the future, the Board
intends to declare annual
distributions provided they
would not be detrimental to
the financial strength of the
Society.
The cost of living, rising Bank
rate and inflation all presented
fresh challenges for us and our

members amidst uncertainty
in the UK economy, changes
across government, and
extreme volatility from the
‘mini-Budget’ in September
2022. However, throughout
the year Nationwide
maintained its strength and
continues to be a well-trusted
brand on the UK high street1.
The Nationwide Board has
faced these challenges head
on and discharged its duties
with due care to ensure that
Nationwide is set up for
long-term success. You can
read more about the strategic
decisions we have taken,
how we engaged with our
stakeholders, and how our
mutual status is at the heart of
our approach in greater detail
on pages 29 to 39.
On behalf of the Board, I would
like to thank all our colleagues

for their hard work and stand
out customer service during
another challenging year.
The year has seen Nationwide
welcome its first female CEO,
Debbie Crosbie, who led the
team that extended the Branch
Promise, delivered strong
financial performance and
supported our members and
colleagues through the cost
of living pressures. We have
also continued to progress our
key agendas on inclusion and
diversity and sustainability.
Nationwide has publicly
committed to net-zero and its
intermediate science-based
targets, albeit this remains
subject to broader public
policy in order to achieve
the long-term goals. Further
detail on all this activity can be
found on pages 46 to 64.

The Board engaged with
members, customers and
colleagues during the year
through TalkBack sessions,
both in person, online, or a
combination of both. This
new approach enabled
the Board to engage more
frequently and with more
people than before the
pandemic and will be
continued.
I am pleased to be able to
confirm that two out of four
of our most senior Board
positions are now held by
women, as recognised in the
FTSE Women Leaders Review
2023, and that our Board is
broadly balanced between
men and women. The Board
continues to oversee progress
against inclusion and diversity
targets and hold executive

management to account to
deliver greater diversity across
the workforce.
Within the organisation, we
continued to focus on the
management of risks and
controls and held executive
management to account to
deliver improvements at pace.
Our new CEO is committed to
making these improvements
and the Board supports her in
this entirely.
I have set out in the
Governance report the key
changes that have been made
to the Board this year on
page 78, but I would like to
extend my thanks to Mai
Fyfield and Gunn Waersted for
their counsel and service. Both
Mai and Gunn will step down
at the AGM and we wish them
well. In turn, I welcome Tracey
Graham as the incoming
Senior Independent Director,
subject to regulatory approval.

Chairman’s Letter (continued)

The Board continues to
demonstrate its commitment
to diversity of thought in its
appointments.
As I look to the year ahead, I
am confident that Nationwide
will remain resilient in the
face of continued political and
economic uncertainty and that
the mutual model will continue
to serve our members’
interests well. The Board has
approved a new strategy
and purpose for Nationwide
and we look forward to
overseeing the delivery of
that strategy for the benefit
of Nationwide’s members,
customers, colleagues and the
communities that we serve.

My reflections
on 2022/23
Last year, we started our
modern mutual journey.
We are making good progress
on our strategy, despite the
macroeconomic challenges and
market pressures that impacted
our costs and the cost of living
for our customers. Throughout
this, our colleagues kept their
focus on helping our customers
in the best way possible.
Our financial performance
last year was the strongest on
record. We also delivered our
highest ever level of member
financial benefit, through better
pricing and incentives than the
market average.

As a mutual, we aim to reward
our savings customers with
the highest savings rates
we possibly can, whilst
ensuring we remain financially
sustainable over the longer
term. Our average deposit
rates over the year were 65%
higher than the market average.
Combined with our attractive
current account switching
incentive during October and
November 2022, this increased
our market share of deposit
balances to 9.6%.
We are here to support our
customers today and for the
long term, which is why it is
important that we maintain our
financial strength. Our leverage
ratio, which measures our

ability to withstand economic
shocks, continues to be well
above our minimum regulatory
threshold.
This strength allowed us to
support our customers and
colleagues in new ways. We
invested £100 million, which
included the cost of providing
cashback to current account
customers on their supermarket
shopping when they made
purchases using their debit
cards between February and
April 2023. It also included
cost of living payments for our
colleagues and support for
customers facing cost of living
challenges, including practical
support in our branches, a
dedicated telephone helpline
and an online cost of living hub.

And most notably, our financial
strength has enabled us to
introduce the Nationwide
Fairer Share Payment, which
rewards our members who
have the deepest banking
relationships with us, and the
Nationwide Fairer Share Bond,
with an exclusive interest rate
for members. It is a clear and
positive way of demonstrating
our mutual difference and
aligns with our purpose. You
can find out more information
about it on our website1.
Simultaneously, we have
demonstrated our mutual good
in the communities we serve,
committing £9.6 million over
the year to charitable activities.

Looking
ahead to the
future

We have remained number one for customer satisfaction in our
peer group for eleven years running2, but as our customers’ needs
evolve, we must innovate, adapt and modernise to stay relevant
and distinctive.
We have an exciting journey ahead. We will execute our refreshed
strategy and deliver brilliantly for our customers today as well as
for those of the future.
We will develop new products and services, invest more in
rewarding relationships, make it easier for colleagues to do their
jobs well and demonstrate the real difference that mutuals make in
our society.
Thank you to our customers, who are at the centre of everything
we do. I look forward to another exciting year and to delivering
our new purpose: Banking – but fairer, more rewarding, and for the
good of society.

Deeper, broader, more lifelong
banking relationships that
provide the best value.
We aim to provide our
customers with the best value
in UK banking. Our mutual
model is intrinsically more
rewarding than our banking
peers, as we deliver value
to our customers, rather
than paying dividends to
shareholders. We want to
extend this beyond monetary
value and to create lifelong
relationships.

The customers with the
deepest relationships with us
are our committed members:
those with two or more of our
products4. At 4 April 2023, we
had 3.68 million committed
members. For more information,
see page 24.

Helping people
into homes
We were founded to help
people into homes of their own,
and this remains important
to our strategy today. Our
share of total gross mortgage
lending was 10.8% (2022:
11.8%), reflecting lower gross
lending of £33.6 billion (2022:
£36.5 billion). Strong demand
in the first half of the year was
offset by a softer market in
the second half, when higher
Bank rate and inflation affected
customers’ affordability
assessments, and increased
their caution around borrowing
at higher rates.

Annual Report & Accounts 2023

Strategic report

Governance

We continued to price
competitively and enhanced
our online Mortgage Manager
service, making it easier for
our existing customers to
switch product or extend
their mortgage term to reduce
their mortgage payments. Our
existing mortgage customers
have access to rates that are
at least as good as those for
new customers remortgaging
to us, and we have the
highest retention of mortgage
customers in our peer group5.
We helped over 72,000 first
time buyers into a home of their
own (2022: 87,000), equating
to one in seven (2022: one in
seven) of all first time buyers,
above our share of the wider
market. Our Helping Hand
mortgage has successfully
supported affordability, enabling
first time buyers to borrow more
(up to 5.5 times their salary)
on 5 and 10-year fixed rate
mortgages. It also extends to
95% loan to value, reducing the
pressure on first time buyers of
saving for a larger deposit, and
we offer £500 cashback to help
with moving costs. We continue

Risk report

Financial statements

to ensure we lend responsibly,
with robust underwriting
checks, but without relying
on the Government’s 95%
mortgage guarantee scheme.
In recognition of the support
we have provided, we were
awarded the Best First Time
Buyer Mortgage Provider at the
Moneyfacts Awards 2022.
The buy to let market was
smaller overall, as higher
interest rates in the second
half of the year also impacted
landlords’ affordability and
profitability, limiting their ability
to expand portfolios or raise
capital. The gross lending
market share of our buy to
let subsidiary, The Mortgage
Works (TMW), decreased, to
11.0% (2022: 14.5%), as our
pricing temporarily became less
competitive when the Bank rate
rose and the market contracted.
We became more competitive
in the fourth quarter of the
financial year and refined our
affordability tests for buy to
let customers. This enabled
us to offer mortgages to more
landlords, whilst continuing to
lend in a responsible way.

Supporting those who
save with us

Encouraging more
people to bank with us

We believe in encouraging good
savings habits, and the financial
security this can provide
customers in the long term. We
saw strong growth in customer
deposits over the year. They
increased by £9.1 billion (2022:
£7.7 billion), despite the cost
of living challenges reducing
the savings market overall.
Our market share of deposit
balances grew to 9.6% (2022:
9.4%). This strong growth
reflected the competitiveness
of our savings products, in
particular our Fixed Rate Bonds.

Banking is core to our purpose.
At the 2023 Moneyfacts
Consumer Awards, we were
recognised as Current Account
Switching Provider of the
Year. Overall, we opened
679,000 (2022: 604,000) new
current accounts, increasing
our current account market
share to 10.4% (2022: 10.3%)6.
This was supported by our
market-leading current account
switcher incentive during
October and November 2022,
that offered £200 cashback to
those who switched to us7.

We also increased our variable
savings rates over the year,
to support and retain existing
savers. Our Start to Save Issue
2 account, for those new to
saving, helped over 15,000
people save at least £100 for
the first time with us in the past
year, and over 900 people won
£250 in our prize draw.

Delivering value back
to our customers
As a mutual, we create value for
our customers through better
pricing and incentives. Over the
year, we launched a number of
standout savings products that
rewarded loyalty and supported
our success, including Member
Online Bond and Flex Instant
Saver. We also continued to

our free SavingsWatch service

Our deposits comprise both

On average, we offered interest
rates on deposits that were 65%
higher than the market average,

rates. Our competitive deposit
rates contributed over 70%
of our total member financial
benefit of £1,055 million
(2022: £325 million). For more
information, see page 71.
To support customers a little
further through the cost of

from 9 February to 30 April
2023. Customers earned 5%
cashback on their debit card
purchases at a wide range of
supermarkets and convenience
stores, up to £10 each month.

We are aiming for simply
brilliant customer service,
with a great mobile banking
experience and modern
branches with colleagues
at their heart, to offer
personalised and trusted
support.
In 2023, we ranked 1st for
customer satisfaction among
our peer group for the 11th
year running8. We also measure
our position for satisfaction
across all sectors and, in
January 2023, we finished in
joint 28th position out of 267
organisations, with a score
that was 4.9pts ahead of the
all-sector average9. For more
information, see pages 24
and 25.

Supporting our
customers through
cost of living pressures
As a mutual, supporting our
customers through cost of
living pressures was a priority.

We introduced a number of
initiatives to help them. We
encouraged our customers to
come to us if they had concerns
about their current or future
financial position. We launched
a new cost of living helpline
to make it easier for them
to speak with us. So far, we
have handled over 4,000 calls
through our helpline. We have
provided information and help
to access self-service options
on our cost of living webpage,
and personalised support
through our specialist support
team. We also make referrals
to support charities, including
Citizens Advice, StepChange
and PayPlan, in situations
where customers have debts
across several lenders. We have
donated to these charities to
support them in their work.
For the 38,000 customers
we have identified as being
potentially more vulnerable
to cost of living pressures,
based on their overdraft and
credit usage, we applied an

automatic six-month overdraft
interest holiday. This protected
and supported them to reduce
borrowing without affecting
their credit score. We also
reduced the interest rate for
those on persistent debt plans.
Our Mortgage Manager tool
allows borrowers to review their
terms and consider payment
options, with access to support
if they struggle to meet
repayments.
Our cost of living webpage also
offers information on managing
money and budgeting, and
provides links to help with
existing debt. We held nine
Money Matters webcasts
that provided practical help
with managing money and,
since April 2022, we have
held Money Lessons in over
400 schools, supporting over
40,000 students and increasing
financial inclusion and
knowledge.

Delivering excellent
customer service
We are improving our mobile
banking experience and
continue to invest in our core
digital services. The number
of customers who actively
used our mobile banking app
grew to 4.6 million (2022:
4.2 million), representing
60% of all our active current
account customers. Payments
and transfers through the
banking app increased by 15%.
This year, we extended the
operating hours of our in-app

available 24 hours a day, every
day of the year. We currently
support around 200,000
conversations a month through
this channel.

Developing our branch
network for the future
Our customers rely on our
branches and sometimes prefer
to speak to us face to face.
We extended our Branch
Promise, and will keep a
branch in every town or city
we are in today, until at least
2024 – another example of
the difference that being a
mutual makes. This year we

branches to modernise
them and improve customer
experience. We now have the
second largest single-brand
branch network across the
UK financial services sector
and, at the 2023 Moneyfacts
Consumer Awards, we won the
Branch Network of the Year
award.
We continue to use colleagues
in branches to serve more
of our customers in different
ways, including face to
face, by phone and through
online messaging. Following
a successful trial, as at
4 April 2023, 50 of our 606
branches are now closed
for one or two days each
week to enable colleagues to
support customers in other
ways. In some exceptional
circumstances that were
beyond our control, and in
some towns and cities where
we had more than one location,
we have closed branches.
However, this is kept to a
minimum and last year only
23 branches were closed.

Protecting our customers in
challenging circumstances
We continue to work to protect our
customers from fraud. Last year,
our fraud defence systems and
specialist fraud team helped prevent
£115 million (2022: £97 million) of
attempted fraud on card and online
transactions. In addition to this, since
its launch in 2021, our Scam Checker
Service has helped prevent a further
£6.1 million of potential scams.
Meeting the needs of all our
customers, including those in
vulnerable circumstances, is
important to us. Our specialist
teams support our most vulnerable
customers, and we partner with
gambling, debt, and mental health
charities where customers need
assistance beyond their banking
needs.

We are playing our part to
address the impact of climate
change and support the UK in
its progress towards a net-zero
carbon emissions future by
2050. We joined the Net-Zero
Banking Alliance and Glasgow
Financial Alliance for Net Zero
in 2021 and, in 2022, set highly
challenging intermediate (by
2030) science-based targets11
to work towards.

We are proud of the progress
we have made to reduce

operations. Since 2018, all our
electricity has been supplied
from renewable sources, and
we have remained carbon
neutral (no net release of
carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere12) for all energy
use and our internal operations
since 2020. Our intermediate
(by 2030) science-based
targets also cover our supply
chain and we have built climate

third-party processes. For more

We offer a range of green
propositions and initiatives
to support our customers to
reduce their carbon footprint

very limited control over
practical measures to reduce
emissions from properties
owned by our borrowers,
and we recognise that we
will not be able to achieve

effectively support the delivery of our strategic drivers. Our new measures for 2023/24 are set out on pages 26 to 28.

Committed members

Member financial benefit

Core products satisfaction

What do we measure?
Our committed members measure reflects the
depth of our relationship with our members,
through the number of core products that they
hold with us1.

Member financial benefit measures the additional
financial value we provide for members from
better pricing and incentives than the market
average, across our mortgage, savings and
banking products.

The Financial Research Survey (FRS)
measures customer satisfaction in our peer
group for our three core products combined
(mortgages, savings and current accounts).

How did we perform against our targets over 2022/23?
We have 3.68 million committed members, below
our 3.75 million target for 2022/23. Growth in
this measure, over the year, was impacted by
the effects of the cost of living pressures on
members’ ability to save.

We provided £1,055 million of member financial
benefit, above our target of at least £400 million,
and a record for the Society. This was driven
primarily by our competitive savings rates,
supported by the increases in Bank rate that gave
us more opportunities to pass on further value to
our savings members.

We have been no.1 for customer satisfaction
among our peer group for 11 years running.
Although our score in 2022/23 was as strong
as the previous year, our lead of 3.8%pts over
our nearest peer group competitor was below
our target lead of 4%pts2.

Our Blueprint for a modern mutual

In 2022/23, Nationwide approved a new strategy and business purpose. Our new approach is centred around our purpose:
Banking – but fairer, more rewarding, and for the good of society, and our four strategic drivers.

More rewarding
relationships

Beacon for
mutual good

We will create deeper, lifelong relationships with our customers, that
provide the best value in banking. We will increase value and reward loyalty
for those customers who do more with us, including through targeted and
competitive mortgage, savings and current account products. And we will
continue to focus on helping first time buyers into homes.

As we go about our business, we will be recognised as a beacon
for mutual good. We want to be famous for the meaningful impact we have
across customers, communities and society as a whole. We will use our
voice to drive positive change and fairer banking practices, and support
charitable activities that align with our purpose and ambitions.

In 2022/23, we helped one in seven (2021/22: one in seven) first time
buyers, provided cashback on supermarket shopping1, and held one in ten
(2021/22: one in ten)2 of the UK’s current accounts.

In 2022/23, we committed £9.6 million (2021/22: £7.1 million) to charitable
activities, plus an additional £1 million to our debt partners and charities,
and committed to a net-zero carbon future, setting science-based targets.

Simply
brilliant service

Continuous
improvement

The value we provide will be beyond rates, with distinctive, personalised
service that stands out for ease, accessibility, security and trust, at every
touchpoint. We will differentiate our mobile banking experience and
combine this with modern branches that offer personal support when
customers need it most.

We will be focused, fit and fast and simplify our processes and ways of
working so that we deliver at pace, for the benefit of our customers, while
retaining resilient controls that protect our customers and their money.

In 2022/23, we were number one for customer satisfaction among our
peer group3, we extended our Branch Promise to 2024 and extended our
operating hours for online chat to provide 24/7 availability, 365 days a year.

In 2022/23, we modernised our payments systems, reduced our card reader
requirements, and simplified our processes to improve and increase support
for customers.

In 2023/24 we will measure our performance on those things we consider
to be core to these strategic drivers, as set out on page 28.

Our strategic key performance indicators for 2023/24
We have updated our key performance indicators for 2023/24 to those that most effectively track
the progress of our refreshed strategy. They align to our four strategic drivers as follows:

More rewarding relationships – creating deeper, lifelong relationships with our customers that
provide the best value in banking

• Measure: Engaged customers – where a customer has a main personal current account with
us, plus either a savings balance of at least £100 or a mortgage of at least £100.

Simply brilliant service – service that stands out for ease, accessibility, security and trust at

every touch point

• Measure: Customer experience score – based on the feedback customers provide when
they complete our survey after they interact with us, across our branches, telephone and
digital channels.

Beacon for mutual good – we want to be famous for the meaningful impact we have across
customers, communities and society as a whole

• Measure: Heard good things about Nationwide – the proportion of consumers who have
heard good things about Nationwide, ranked against peer brands as part of our brand
tracking survey.

Continuous improvement – ensuring our financial strength through efficient and effective
processes and risk management

• Measure: Leverage ratio – which demonstrates our financial strength, as we progress the
delivery of our refreshed strategy.
In addition, our current Mutual Good Commitments support our Beacon for mutual good strategic
driver. More information on them can be found on page 46.
A number of these key performance indicators are also linked to the way we pay our colleagues,
including at executive management level. For more information, please see the Report of the
directors on remuneration, within the Governance report.
The targets for these measures will be finalised during the first half of the year and will be
reported against in the Annual Report and Accounts 2024.

Section 172(1) statement
This section describes how the directors considered
matters set out in section 172(1) of the Companies Act
2006 (the ‘Act’). This also forms the directors’ statement
required under section 414CZA of the Act. Although
Nationwide, as a building society, is not required to
follow the Act, we seek to apply its requirements where
appropriate.

Our stakeholders
Listening to and engaging regularly with our stakeholders
is fundamental to the way we do business, and it ensures
we operate in a balanced and responsible way, both in
the short and longer term. Their views are important to
us and they help to guide our decision making.
In this section, we summarise how we have engaged
with, and responded to, feedback from each of our
key stakeholder groups during the year, both at a
broader Society level and at Board level. In addition, key
decisions taken by the Board in the year and its related
consideration of relevant stakeholders are set out on
pages 36 to 39.

Retail members and customers
As a mutual, we are here to support our customers,
including our members (who are our customers with
a current account, mortgage or savings with us). It is
therefore important we understand their needs, now and
in the future. More information on how we have delivered
value and excellent service for them can be found on
pages 12 to 22.

Our engagement
At our Annual General Meeting (AGM), our members can
have their say and vote on important issues. In July 2022,
our AGM was held as a hybrid meeting so that members
could choose to join in person, at our Head Office in
Swindon, or online. For the first time, members were
able to vote online during the meeting, and could ask live
questions directly to the Board via an online platform.
The 2022 AGM was attended by 281 members online and
32 attended in person.

We also held 30 online education events. These events
included education on how to recognise scams, and

manage their money online, safely and securely.
In addition, we engaged with members through our
Member Connect online forum, which provides a platform
for members to share their views with us on a range of
subjects.

The themes of the topics raised by members and
customers at our AGM and TalkBacks, and via
Member Connect, included:
•

Cost of living pressures

•

Protection from fraud and scams

•

Benefits of membership (including product rates
and offers)

•

Maintaining access to branches and access to cash

•

Inclusion and diversity

•

Executive remuneration

•

Acting responsibly, including our approach to climate
change and net-zero commitments

We responded to this by:
•

Supporting our customers impacted by the
cost of living pressures (see page 17)

•

Protecting our customers from fraud
(see page 18)

•

Supporting our vulnerable customers
(see page 18)

•

Board engagement
During the year, we held a number of virtual and inperson events, giving our customers the opportunity to
meet Board directors and senior management.
Our members were able to engage with our Board
directors at our AGM and Talkbacks. All three of our
TalkBack events had a non-executive director present on
the panel. Board members also visited branches to hear
members’ views.
The 2023 AGM will be hosted entirely online for the first
time. Members will be invited to participate online, where
they can submit live questions, and vote online during
the meeting.
The Board reviewed customer service and satisfaction
data at all its meetings and was engaged on, and
approved, the extension of the Branch Promise.
The Board and the Board Risk Committee reviewed and
challenged the approach and activity being undertaken
by the Society to ensure it was fully prepared for the
implementation of the FCA’s Consumer Duty. More

Buy to let customers
We support landlords and those who rely on the private
rented sector for their long-term housing needs. We
do this through our buy to let mortgage business, The
Mortgage Works, and we aim to be the most trusted
partner for landlords.

Our engagement
We provided education and features through our landlord
website to support landlords’ understanding of their
responsibilities and the provision of better homes for
renters. This benefits all types of landlords, including
those running their portfolios as a limited company. We
actively monitor changes in the buy to let sector through
research organisations and develop content accordingly.
This includes working with our research provider to
gain quarterly feedback from landlords and respond
appropriately where possible.

Our engagement with landlords included the
following key topics:
•

Cost of living pressures and the rise in Bank rate

•

Interpreting the implications of the Government’s
Levelling Up the United Kingdom white paper

•

Landlords’ relationships with their tenants

We responded to this by:
•

•

Supporting landlords facing higher interest rates
by pricing products for existing landlord customers
with the same rates as new landlord customers and
extending the period for landlords to switch product
ahead of their mortgage product maturing from 6
weeks to 13 weeks, enabling them to secure a new
rate earlier.
Sending a monthly email to our landlord subscribers
with legislation changes and housing market news
affecting landlords and their tenants. We also
published blogs on our landlord website covering
topics relevant to elements of landlord life. These
included changes in smoke and carbon monoxide
regulations during 2022, the Government’s white
paper on a fairer private rented sector, and tips for
improving relationships between landlords
and tenants.

Board engagement
While the Board has not engaged directly with buy to
let customers, it received regular reports on buy to let
lending and engagement and discussed the pressures
facing landlords and tenants as part of these updates.
Our Landlord Strategy was reviewed and noted by the
Board during the year.

Colleagues
Our colleagues are at the heart of serving our customers
and delivering our strategy. We are committed to building
a supportive and inclusive environment for our colleagues.
We want to help them to be at their best and to thrive by
building a culture where they feel supported and valued,
and can grow their careers. On page 32, you can read
more about how we support our colleagues.

Our engagement
We invite all colleagues to share their views on working
at Nationwide, the challenges they face and what works
well, through monthly surveys. On average, 43% of
colleagues respond each month, providing important
insight for managers to use in their decision making.

•

Resourcing, training and developing multi-channel
skills (in branches)

•

Improving our social mobility

•

Products and propositions

•

Inclusion, diversity and wellbeing

•

Speaking up

We responded to this by:
•

Supporting our colleagues impacted by the cost of
living pressures

•

Launching our social mobility network

•

Launching our new Resolution Framework, to
support speaking up and helping to resolve
grievances by encouraging collaboration and
appreciating diverse views. This reduced resolution
timeframes by 40% (on a sample taken 3 months
post implementation).

More information on our support for our colleagues is set
out on the next page.

We also gathered colleague insights and feedback
through other surveys, including the MIND Wellbeing
Index, and through engagement with Employee Network
Groups and the Nationwide Group Staff Union (NGSU). In
addition, we answered questions and sought feedback
during webcasts that discussed important and timely
topics, such as our refreshed strategy, senior leadership
introductions and organisational structure changes.

Board engagement

When we made organisational changes impacting
colleagues, we engaged with those impacted and the
NGSU.

To further promote engagement between the Board
and colleagues, the Board appoints one director to
have specific responsibility for the Employee Voice in
the Boardroom. The Board also appoints one director
with responsibility for overseeing the integrity and
effectiveness of our employee whistleblowing policies
and procedures.

Key topics raised by colleagues included:
•

Cost of living support (for customers and colleagues)

•

Changes to our workplaces

•

Leadership, strategy and organisational changes

•

Pay, bonuses and pensions

The Board engaged with colleagues throughout the year
as the Society transitioned through leadership changes.
The Chairman led two non-executive director Townhall
events, face to face and virtually, where colleagues were
able to question and engage with our Board.

The Board received updates on the results of employee
engagement surveys and welcomed the General
Secretary of the NGSU to a Board meeting during the
year to discuss the alignment of interests between the
NGSU and the Society.

Engaging with our stakeholders (continued)

A focus on our Colleagues
We are committed to building a supportive and inclusive
environment for our colleagues. In doing so, we will
create a high-performance, purpose-driven culture
where they can thrive and develop rewarding careers.

Supporting our colleagues’ financial wellbeing
We want to support our colleagues, including their
financial wellbeing, through the cost of living pressures.
Our cost of living initiatives that we offer to customers
are also available to any of our colleagues who are
customers. In addition, in August 2022, we made a
one-off £1,200 cost of living payment to support over
11,000 of our colleagues earning less than £35,000.
We also introduced a new pay package, effective from
1 April 2023, increasing pay three months earlier than
normal. This delivered significant increases in pay for
colleagues, particularly for those on lower salaries, with
the majority of colleagues receiving a 6.5% increase on
existing base pay.
Our Employee Care helpline is available to all Nationwide
employees and dependants1 and provides a free
counselling, health and wellbeing, legal information, and
debt support service.

Refreshing our hybrid working commitments
In November, we refreshed our commitment to hybrid
working. While some elements remain unchanged,
for example the requirement to work within the UK
and our commitment to flexibility, we also set clearer
expectations on coming together in person to maintain
relationships, support our culture and to collaborate.
We have developed initiatives and guidelines to support
colleagues and leaders working in a hybrid environment,
including networking events to encourage new joiners
and colleagues to meet across our office locations, as
well as role-specific guidance.

Building our inclusive culture
We are working to build an inclusive culture and we want
our Society to reflect the diversity of the communities
we serve. We need a diverse range of backgrounds,
skills and experiences to help us continue to serve our
customers in the best way and offer the services and
products that are most relevant to them.
Our inclusion measures help us monitor how inclusive
our culture is. In April 2023, 84% (2022: 81%) of our
colleagues, including 79% (2022: 73%) of our ethnically
diverse colleagues, felt everyone had an equal
opportunity to thrive, regardless of background. Our
diversity measures, which underpin our Mutual Good
Commitment to reflect the diversity of wider society, are
reported each month to the Board and the leadership
team.
In 2022, we partnered with Progress Together, a
membership body centred on progression, retention and
socio-economic diversity in financial services. With their
support and input, we began to gather voluntary socioeconomic data from our colleagues in January 2023. This
will enable us to benchmark our socio-economic diversity
against our peers and inform our future inclusion,
diversity, and wellbeing priorities.
Our new social mobility employee network became our
eleventh employee network. The others are: gender;
ethnicity; sexual orientation; disability; faith and belief;
working carers; working families; veterans and reservists;
mental wellbeing; and sustainability. Our networks
celebrate diversity, such as with an Asian Experience
Month, Black History Month and Pride Month, and help
colleagues build support networks and drive supportive
changes. For example, they introduced trained workplace
menopause coaches and built special educational needs
(SEN) inclusion into our volunteering work on Money
Lessons in schools.

In 2022, our Race Together Network was awarded the
Network Group of the year at the Ethnicity Awards. Minds
Matter, our mental wellbeing network, was shortlisted for
Best New Mental Health Initiative in the InsideOut Awards
2023 and our Proud network was shortlisted for British
LGBT Network Group of the year in the British LGBT
Awards.
In the 2023 Financial Times’ Diversity Leaders list,
which surveys more than 100,000 employees on their
perceptions of organisations’ inclusivity and efforts to
promote diversity, we were the highest-ranked UK high
street financial services provider for the second year
running2. We were also awarded Gold Employer standard
by Stonewall for our work on LGBTQ+ inclusion.

Understanding our gender and ethnicity pay gaps
At 5 April 2022, our gender pay gap was 30.0% (2021:
30.0%). This means we have a higher proportion of
women in lower paid roles than in senior roles. Although
we increased the proportion of women in senior roles,
the proportion of women in entry-level and less senior
roles also increased, and so our gender pay gap was
unchanged.
We are one of the few organisations to voluntarily publish
our ethnicity pay gap. At 5 April 2022, our ethnicity pay
gap was 7.4% (2021: 11.3%), with more ethnically diverse
employees in lower paid roles than in senior roles. The
reduction in pay gap was supported by an increase in the
proportion of ethnically diverse colleagues in mid-level
roles.
Pay gaps are different to equal pay. Equal pay looks at
how colleagues are paid for doing the same or similar
work. We regularly monitor pay to ensure our pay policies
are not biased. For more information, see our Gender and
Ethnicity Pay Gaps report on our website3.

Mortgage intermediaries

Board engagement

•

We have around 28,000 mortgage intermediaries who
place business with us, accounting for over 80% of all the
mortgages we provide.

The Board has been updated on intermediary
engagement during the year, receiving updates on broker
recommendation scores.

environment

•

Capital strength and expected wholesale funding
requirements

•

Competition within the UK financial services sector

•

Sustainability, in particular the Society’s approach to
climate change

Our engagement
We regularly canvass our mortgage brokers on their
views on our products and service. This includes
through the use of third-party firms to obtain feedback
on applications submitted and perceptions of us as a
mortgage provider.
We also gathered feedback through six-monthly and ad
hoc workshops where brokers provided feedback on
their experiences directly to the colleagues responsible
for formulating products and policy.

Our engagement with mortgage intermediaries
included discussion on the following topics:
•

Improving service

•

Digital integration

•

Consumer Duty principles

•

Supporting first time buyers

We responded to this by:
•

Enhancing our digital application process to speed
up the mortgage application submission process for
intermediaries.

•

Continuing to engage with various trade bodies and
having representatives in important forums such
as the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association
(IMLA). This ensures Nationwide can influence how
the mortgage industry develops.

•

Maintaining a constant presence in the mortgage
market during the uncertain economic times of 2022,
when other lenders withdrew, providing consistency
for both our intermediaries and our borrowers.

Investors and rating agencies
Our wholesale funding investors support us in meeting
our funding and capital requirements. Our investors are
interested in our financial performance and sustainability
practices and use our credit and Environmental,
Social and Governance (ESG) ratings to support their
understanding.

We responded to this by:
•

Continuing to provide timely strategic and financial
updates to our investors. As the economic
environment evolved we adapted our disclosures
to meet investors’ information needs and areas of
interest.

•

Continuing to enhance our climate-related financial
disclosures as investor demand increased. In
December 2022, in keeping with our commitments
following our sign-up to the Net-Zero Banking
Alliance (NZBA), we published our intermediate
(by 2030) science-based targets, supported by
comprehensive disclosures detailing how we will
progress towards these.

Our engagement
We maintain an active dialogue with investors
who support us in meeting our funding and capital
requirements. This includes during the due diligence
process ahead of wholesale funding issuances and in
responding to general queries. Our Investor Relations
programme provides existing and potential investors with
the opportunity to meet senior managers and executive
directors of the Society. In the year, we updated our
investors on our latest financial performance and
provided information on areas of interest to investors,
such as our ESG activities.
To support investors’ understanding of our performance
and risk management, we engaged with credit and
ESG rating agencies to ensure the Society is rated
appropriately. This led to an upgrade in the Society’s ESG
ratings with Sustainalytics and MSCI.

Key areas of interest for our investor base included:
•

Strategic objectives and leadership changes

•

Impacts of an uncertain economic and geopolitical
outlook

•

Housing market outlook and implications for the
mortgage market

Board engagement
On behalf of the Board, the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Officer provided a comprehensive update
directly to investors following each of our external results
announcements. The Chief Financial Officer also led an
investor roundtable, as well as a series of meetings with
our largest investors in the weeks following our results
announcements, to answer their questions.

Communities

•

As a mutual organisation, our focus is not just on
providing better value and service for our customers, but
on being better for society too. That is why we commit
at least 1% of our pre-tax profits5 to good causes. Last
year, these largely focused on housing and our work with
community partners and charities to support our local
communities.

Board engagement

Our engagement
Our Community Grants programme enables charities
across the UK to apply for grants that support people
and communities in housing need. We held 11 Community
Boards, where community grants were distributed under
the direction of member and colleague volunteers.
We also engaged with and supported our communities
through our employee volunteering programme, and our
long-term partnership with charity Shelter.
We worked closely with the local community in the
design and planning of 239 EPC A-rated homes at our
Oakfield housing development in Swindon.

Our engagement with communities included the
following key topics:

Appointing Lovell as our new construction partner
on Oakfield and putting the first homes on sale in
December 2022.

The Board received updates on the Society’s
social investment strategy and on the work of the
11 Community Boards. This included updates on
the Community Grants programme and Nationwide’s
partnership with Shelter. The Board received regular
updates on the Oakfield development.
The Board also received four updates on the Society’s

Board decisions
At the heart of our mutual purpose is the need to engage, consult
with and act in the interests of our stakeholders. The Board is
responsible for setting a clear strategy and direction, ensuring the
long-term success and sustainability of the Society. When making
decisions, it considers the outcome for all relevant stakeholders,
as well as the need to maintain a reputation for high standards of
business conduct, the need to act fairly, and the consequences
of its decisions. The Board and Board committee terms of
references available at nationwide.co.uk reflect the importance
of considering the requirements set out in section 172(1) of the
Act. The template for writing Board and Board committee papers
must include a section for authors to outline how the update or
proposal directly or indirectly impacts our key stakeholder groups.
The Board reviews this as part of its assessment to determine the
relevant stakeholder impacts.
Principal decisions are those decisions taken by the Board,
including decisions taken by or delegated to management which
the Board has oversight of, that are of strategic importance,
material to the operations of the business and are significant to
the Society’s key stakeholders. This statement describes three
examples of principal decisions taken during the year.

Setting a new strategy

What was the
decision-making
process?
Following the appointments
of the Chairman and CEO,
a strategy refresh was
discussed by the Board at
its September 2022 meeting
before being considered
at its Strategy Conference
in October 2022. The new
strategy built on the Society’s
reputation for providing
great service and long-term
member value by setting out
the strategic direction for
the delivery of operational
and service excellence, and
the delivery of compelling
banking propositions, whilst
recognising the Society’s
mutual heritage and its
commitment to making a
positive contribution to
society.

At the October 2022 Strategy
Conference, views on the
proposed new strategy
were gathered from Board
members, senior management
and external advisors
to ensure that it was an
appropriate step forward.
The Board scrutinised and
challenged the priorities of
the new strategy, particularly
the proposals to enhance
operational and service
delivery and member value.
The Board also sought to
understand how the strategy
would be delivered over three
horizon timelines.
At its November 2022 meeting
the Board reviewed and
approved the final version of
the strategy and agreed how
it would monitor execution
delivery.

How did the directors
fulfil their duties under
section 172 and how
were stakeholders
considered?
Stakeholder considerations
were central to the decisionmaking process. The new
strategy was built around
member, colleague and
regulator feedback on how
the Society’s processes
and operations could be
enhanced to deliver service
and operational excellence.
The Board was played
footage of member and
colleague feedback at the
Strategy Conference where
members spoke of their
interactions with the Society,
their experiences of service
delivery and the role of
branches in meeting customer
and community needs. The
promotion of the long-term
success of the Society was

also a strong consideration
of the Board when evaluating
the new strategy to ensure
the Society retained credibility
with regulators and investors.

What were the actions
and outcomes?
Following the feedback
provided by the Board, senior
management and other
stakeholders at the October
2022 Strategy Conference,
the new strategy was
refined and subsequently
presented to the November
2022 Board meeting where
it was discussed further,
prior to its approval. At this
November 2022 meeting the
Board discussed how it would
monitor strategy execution
and delivery and agreed to
receive updates via regular
reporting from management.

How did the directors
fulfil their duties under
section 172 and how
were stakeholders
considered?
The Board is aware that
climate change presents a risk
to the Society, its members
and the wider community.
In making climate-related
decisions and disclosures
the Board has been mindful
of and evaluated the likely
long-term consequences and
the impact on communities
and the environment. The
Society has made relevant
disclosures publicly available
so that regulators, investors
and suppliers can assess
how the Society is managing
climate risk. The Board has
also considered implications
of decisions to ensure that
risks from climate change
are managed and effectively
incorporated into the Society’s
governance model.

Regulators

Investors

What were the actions
and outcomes?
In developing the disclosures
and outlining its position
for stakeholders, the Board
recognised these were subject
to key dependencies, for
example that the UK and the
Society would not be able
to reach net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050 without
broader policy changes.
The Society has, therefore,
continued to collaborate with
other mortgage providers
and with government to
support the changes needed
to transition the economy to
net-zero.
The Board continues to
monitor progress against
climate-related financial
disclosures and targets via the
regular reports it receives from
management.

Approach to implementing
the FCA Consumer Duty

What was the
decision-making
process?
The FCA confirmed the final
details of the new Consumer
Duty requirements in July
2022, setting higher and
clearer standards of consumer
protection across financial
services and requiring boards
and management to make
good outcomes for consumers
central to their firm’s culture,
strategy and business
objectives.
The Board recognised that the
Consumer Duty requirements
aligned strongly with the
Society’s mutual ethos and
values but sought assurance
that the Society was making
the necessary preparations
to meet the specific
requirements of the Duty
by the first implementation
deadline of 31 July 2023.
Updates on progress against
the implementation deadline

were presented regularly to
the Board and the Board Risk
Committee who provided
governance oversight and
challenge.
At its meeting in September
2022, the Board Risk
Committee reviewed
and challenged the
proposed Consumer Duty
Implementation Plan.
At its October 2022 meeting,
the Board approved the
Consumer Duty Implementation
Plan which was subsequently
submitted to the FCA.

The Nationwide Foundation is an independent charity set up by the Society
in 1997. Each year, we donate at least 0.25% of Nationwide’s pre-tax profits
to the Nationwide Foundation – £2,405,000 in 2022/23 – as part of the 1%
of pre-tax profits1 we commit to good causes. The Nationwide Foundation’s
vision is for everyone in the UK to have access to a decent home that they
can afford. It uses its funding and influence under three programme areas to
change the housing system for the better.

ideas to change
1 Nurturing
the housing system
This programme supports emerging solutions to create truly
affordable and decent homes for the people most in need. Its work in
2022/23 included:
•

Working with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and FrameWorks
UK to produce a ‘How to talk about homes’ toolkit. This will help
organisations that are campaigning for change, by providing
guidance on the best ways to communicate to help the public
understand the need for more affordable and decent homes, and
to encourage support for solutions.

•

Supporting and funding work by the Town and Country Planning
Association on potential new legislation to make sure homes are
built to benefit the health of the people who live in them. The aim
is to pass a new set of ‘Healthy Homes’ principles into law, such
as adequate space and natural light, that will apply to all
new-build homes.

•

Funding a pioneering project in Bristol that provides homes for
people in need, situated on microsites around existing houses
with a large amount of surrounding space. The Foundation is
working to bring this project to more areas. It is a completely new
way of creating decent, affordable homes which has received
strong interest from ministers.

•

Funding research into the impact of tenancy reform in Scotland,
especially on the tenants who are most vulnerable to harm, and
using the findings to influence further reforms across the UK.

Supported and funded key organisations across the UK that help
community groups to build homes.

•

Funding a programme of work across the UK to support renters
to have their voices heard in local and national decision making.

Funded new work to find out about the challenges faced by
people from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds in creating
community-led housing.

•

Using the findings from its research to influence the upcoming
Renters’ Reform Bill and other legislation to make it as effective
as possible for renters, especially those in need.

•

Continued to advocate for the importance of government funding
to help the community-led housing sector grow further.

During 2023/24, the Nationwide Foundation will remain
committed to its Decent Affordable Homes strategy. While
continuing to generate robust influence through funded work,
it is also increasing its own activity, using the knowledge it
has gathered to influence positive change to the UK’s housing
system.

UN Sustainable development goals
We want to be a beacon for mutual good. Being a responsible business is part of our mutual
heritage and we remain committed to doing business in a way that positively impacts our
customers, employees and communities.
As a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking, we are committed
to a strategic alignment with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and to the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Our Mutual Good Commitments, as set out on the next
page, are most closely aligned to the SDGs listed below.
SDG 1 No poverty

We take positive action against homelessness, and to enhance financial inclusion
and wellbeing, and support and protect our customers’ money.

SDG 5 Gender equality

We promote gender equality and are working towards equal representation
of women in our leadership population by 2028.

SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy

Since 2018, we have continued to source 100% of our electricity for our
own operations from renewable sources.

SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth

We are a real living wage employer, promote positive work practices and
take action to enhance the wellbeing, diversity and inclusion of our people.

SDG 10 Reduced inequalities

We are working to reduce economic inequality in our communities and seek
to ensure everyone has access to good and secure housing, finances and
work opportunities.

SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities

Our social investment programme helps us give back to our communities. And we
work on solutions to create affordable, accessible and sustainable homes.

SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production

We divert as much waste as possible from landfill, recycle our office equipment and
source food locally. Our Procurement for Mutual Good programme supports a greener,
more inclusive and more ethical supply chain.

SDG 13 Climate action

We are part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, committing to a net-zero future by 2050 and have published
intermediate (by 2030) science-based targets in support. Our green propositions encourage our customers
to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

By 2025, we will help 250,000
people to buy their first home1.

We continue to focus on helping first time buyers into homes.
We are working to address the two main challenges that first time
buyers face – raising a deposit and being able to borrow enough
to afford a property. Since setting our target in November 2020,
we have helped 196,000 people into their first home, ahead of
our cumulative target for 2023. More information on how we are

Over a fifth of the 4.4 million households that rent privately in
England endure the poor conditions associated with substandard
housing3. With many of our customers in rented accommodation,
we seek to enable a private rented sector that works for the mutual
good of both landlords and tenants. We ensure that the buy to let
properties we lend on are compliant with, or exceed, the Decent
Homes Standard2,3 recommendations, so that tenants can live in
safe and decent homes.

By 2025, we will have
provided £1 billion of new
lending to support the social
housing sector4.

Our partner charity, Shelter, is calling on the government to build
at least 90,000 social homes a year, to ensure everyone has a safe
place to call home5.

Our progress

We aim to reduce our scope 1 emissions that we control across
our own business operations, in line with our 2030 scope 1
science-based target, and remain carbon neutral for these
emissions7.

In December 2022, Nationwide published its intermediate (by 2030) science-based targets. Our
Mutual Good Commitment measures now reflect these. You can find out more about our sciencebased targets in our Intermediate Net-Zero Ambitions 2022: Basis of Preparation, and our Climaterelated Financial Disclosures 2023.

We aim to continue to source 100% renewable electricity for our
own operations, in line with our 2030 scope 2 science-based
target.

We will aim to reduce our scope 3 emissions for our mortgages,
other secured lending activity, and our supply chain, by
taking steps to reduce those emissions within our control and
encouraging our customers, borrowers and suppliers to do the
same, in line with our 2030 scope 3 science-based target.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions are also included in our directors’ long-term variable pay targets. For more
information on this, please see page 124.
We consider it highly unlikely at present, that our measures for scope 3 investments emissions can
be achieved under current government policies in connection with the UK’s housing stock. Emissions
associated with our residential mortgage lending account for the majority (more than 80%) of our total
scope 3 emissions and we have very limited control over practical measures to reduce the emissions
from properties which are owned by our borrowers.

7. Carbon neutral refers to no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and is achieved by removing or eliminating emissions, or through funding equivalent carbon savings.

Over the year, we extended our Branch Promise once again, providing reassurance to our customers who rely on our branches, or prefer

won the Branch Network of the Year award at the 2023 Moneyfacts Consumer Awards.

We will commit at least 1%
of our pre-tax profits to
charitable activities each year8.

We met our target in 2022/23, committing £9.6 million (2021/22: £7.1 million). More information can be found on page 19.

In some exceptional circumstances that were beyond our control, and in some towns and cities where we had more than one location, we
have closed branches. However, this is kept to a minimum and last year only 23 branches were closed.

Our progress

By 2028, our people will reflect

We achieved four of our seven measures to meet by 2023. These measures are set out on the next page. However, further focus is
needed to increase representation of Black, Asian, mixed and other ethnically diverse colleagues in senior roles and across our overall
employee population. We are also slightly behind where we planned to be in terms of the proportion of women in our leadership
population. We aim to address this, and further the progress we have made across our other measures, through the delivery of our
refreshed strategy, which includes activity to improve social mobility.

This includes seven measures
that span across gender,
ethnicity, disability and sexual
orientation, as set out on the
next page.

We will improve diverse representation and progression through a holistic and embedded inclusion and diversity approach to talent
identification, succession, development and management. This includes ensuring that we have robust data and we put key data into the
hands of decision makers to enable evidence-based decision making and consistently inclusive practices to drive sustainable progress.
For more information on the work we are doing to progress inclusion, diversity and wellbeing, including our gender and ethnicity pay gaps,

Diversity measures are also included in our directors’ long-term variable pay targets. For more information on this, please see page 124.

regardless of their ethnicity, faith and belief, gender, marital status,
age, physical or mental disability, or socio-economic background.
For colleagues with disabilities and long-term health conditions, the
Society supports them with workplace adjustments. Should colleagues
become disabled while employed, the Society will, wherever possible,
make adjustments to support them in their existing role or re-deploy

Ambition
and overview
Climate change presents a risk to Nationwide and its customers, and so managing the risk
from climate change and supporting progress towards a greener society is core to Nationwide
being a responsible business.
We continue to focus on further embedding and improving our
climate-related risk management capabilities, whilst enhancing
our understanding of climate change and the impacts it has on the
Society and its customers.
Environmental and climate consciousness are aligned to our
mutual purpose of Banking – but fairer, more rewarding, and for
the good of society. Being a beacon for mutual good is a core part
of our strategy, which is centred around our purpose. It compels
us to take meaningful action to limit the environmental impact of
our business operations, help our customers green their homes
(so that they are warmer, more comfortable places to live, and
more cost effective to heat in the long term), and manage better
the impacts of a more unpredictable climate. In doing so, we can
demonstrate our mutual difference, that extends beyond our
customer base, and positively impacts our communities and wider
society too.

Since 2020, Nationwide has produced its disclosures in line
with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’
(TCFD’s) recommendations. Nationwide’s Climate-related Financial
Disclosures 2023 are published alongside its Preliminary results
on nationwide.co.uk as a standalone document. This enables
Nationwide to provide comprehensive climate-related disclosures,
in an easily accessible format, for all interested stakeholders.
The table on the next page outlines how we have aligned to
the four categories of the TCFD’s recommendations1 (Strategy,
Governance, Risk management, and Metrics and targets) and
recommended disclosures, and aligns with the Financial Conduct
Authority’s Listing Rules (9.8.6R(8)). Across these categories are
11 sub-category headings which we have used to present our
activities for this year, along with ongoing and future activity.
Page number references have been provided to indicate where
additional detail can be found in Nationwide’s full Climate-related
Financial Disclosures 2023.

Nationwide’s carbon emissions
Supporting progress towards a greener society
As a building society, Nationwide’s focus is on providing banking products and
services for our customers. We only have very limited corporate lending through
small, closed commercial real estate and private finance initiative portfolios, and
lending to registered social landlords.
Our business model means that our strategy does not involve lending to, or
investing in, the fossil fuel industry.
Nationwide aspires to be a beacon for mutual good, famous for having a
meaningful impact across society that extends beyond our own customer base.
Helping address the impact of climate change aligns with this, and we aim to
support the UK Government’s ambition to achieve net-zero by 2050.
Our Mutual Good Commitments support our strategy and the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Over the year we have updated the targets underlying
our Mutual Good Commitment to support progress towards a greener society, so
that they align to our intermediate (by 2030) science-based targets.
Nationwide published its highly challenging intermediate (by 2030) science-based
targets3 in December 2022. This disclosure covers the sectors applicable to our
business model, across scope 1, 2, and 3. Achieving our emissions, and emissions
intensity, reduction targets will require customer, cross-industry, and government
action.

Nationwide’s scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions
(See table on page 64)

We are pleased to have remained carbon neutral for scope 1 and 2 emissions since
2020. These emissions are tracked against a set of strategic ambitions that aim
to improve the Society’s sustainability. We continue to disclose in line with the
Government’s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation requirements.
Our scope 1 emissions have continued to decrease in comparison to previous
years. This is due to our ongoing efforts to reduce our operational emissions. We
will continue to reduce our scope 1 emissions to progress towards our sciencebased target ambitions.
100% of our scope 2 energy consumption is attributed to renewable sources,
through a solar power purchase agreement (PPA), which produces emissions-free
energy, and use of green tariff electricity. Our scope 2 emissions are associated
with purchased electricity only, as Nationwide does not purchase any steam, heat
or cooling. This market-based approach4, coupled with purchasing carbon offsets
for scope 1 emissions, ensures Nationwide remains carbon neutral for its business
operations.
We also disclose our absolute (location-based5) scope 2 emissions which
continue to reduce as we embed new hybrid ways of working. Our hybrid working
means colleagues have the flexibility to choose where they work between home
and the office, with an expectation that they come together when it is valuable
and meaningful to do so, to maintain relationships, support our culture and
collaborate.

4. A market-based approach allows flexibility to utilise market-based measures such as renewable energy to achieve net-zero.
5. A location-based approach doesn’t factor in market-based measures and considers operational absolute emissions only.

Nationwide’s scope 3 downstream category 15
(investments) carbon emissions – mortgages, registered
social landlords, and commercial real estate
(See table on page 64)

Nationwide continues to disclose the emissions associated with its mortgage,
commercial real estate (CRE) and registered social landlord (RSL) portfolios. We
have calculated both the absolute and the financed emissions for our mortgage,
CRE and RSL portfolios. The absolute emissions have been weighted by loan
to value (LTV) in order to calculate the proportion of emissions financed by
Nationwide. This is in line with Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials
(PCAF) methodology.
Our absolute scope 3 mortgage emissions have reduced in comparison to last
year, due to a reduction in the total number of properties on the book. LTV
weighted emissions, and LTV weighted carbon intensity, have increased slightly
compared to last year due to an increase in average LTV. Our absolute and
LTV weighted emissions, LTV weighted carbon intensity, and total floor area,
for the RSL portfolio have reduced compared to last year. This is due to the
enhancements made to our EPC model to include postcode matching capability.
Our absolute scope 3 CRE emissions, and LTV weighted emissions, have reduced
in comparison to last year, due to a decrease in overall lending.
Information on how scope 3 emissions for mortgages, CRE and RSL have been
calculated is in our Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2023.

Nationwide’s scope 3 upstream (categories 1, 2, and 4)
carbon emissions
(See table on page 64)

Through our partnership with Carbon Intelligence, we have calculated our scope
3 emissions for upstream activities across our supply chain. Purchased goods and
services (category 1), capital goods (category 2) and upstream transportation and
distribution (category 4) account for around 91% of our total emissions across
categories 1-8.
Our upstream emissions have been calculated using publicly disclosed supplier
emissions data (covering scopes 1-3) from CDP environmental disclosure
responses, and revenue from the most recently published annual reports, where
available. Data gaps were supplemented using industry average emissions
contained within the GHG Protocol and Quantis’s Scope 3 Evaluator tool.
Emissions data excludes emissions from employees working at home.

Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions assurance
We appointed Ernst and Young LLP (EY) to provide limited independent assurance
over our scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emission disclosures for the year ended 4 April
2023. This includes scope 1 and 2 emissions for the year ended 4 April 2023 and
scope 3 financed (investment and upstream) emissions for the 12-month period
ended 31 December 2022. Assurance was also provided for the year ended 4 April
2022, as disclosed in our Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2022. Assured
metrics and KPIs are indicated throughout Nationwide’s Climate-related Financial
Disclosures 2023. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in
accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
(UK) 3000 (July 2020), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews
of Historical Financial Information. A limited assurance report was issued and
is available on Nationwide’s website6. This report includes details of the scope,
respective responsibilities, work performed, limitations and conclusion.

Risk overview

Other information

The Board recognises that effective risk management is essential to Nationwide’s ongoing strength and the delivery of our strategic objectives. As such, we adopt a prudent approach to
risk management, keeping our customers’ money safe and secure by ensuring that the risks we take in support of our strategy are controlled through a robust risk framework. We operate
a relatively simple business model and operate in lower risk markets to serve our customers’ interests and keep their money safe and secure by taking risks we understand and can
manage well.

How risk is managed at Nationwide
Nationwide operates a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Management Framework to ensure risks are managed in a consistent and rigorous way. This framework defines how risks are
managed and sets out the risk management responsibilities of all colleagues within an industry standard three lines of defence model. This ensures that all risks are appropriately and
consistently identified, assessed, managed, monitored, and reported within the first line of defence. Independent oversight and challenge of the Society’s risk management practices are
provided by the Society’s independent Risk function, led by the Chief Risk Officer, whilst the Internal Audit function provides assurance of the effectiveness of our control environment for
the Board.
Through the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the Board formally sets its risk appetite, articulating how much risk it is prepared to take in the pursuit of its objectives. A robust
suite of policies and standards translates this appetite into the localised risk management activities and controls that our colleagues operate on a day-to-day basis to protect our
customers and their money. The Board and management committees receive regular reporting on the Society’s risk profile and key risk metrics to support them in monitoring our position
relative to risk appetite. Further information on the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and its key components is shown in the Managing risk section of the Risk report on page 139.
Nationwide continuously reviews the risks to which it is exposed and strengthens the controls it relies on to mitigate these risks. A programme has been completed to develop
further the organisation’s understanding of the most prominent risks and controls within key customer facing processes, which is driving continued improvements to customer
experiences and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of key processes and controls.

Risks to Nationwide
The risks which Nationwide faces can be divided across two broad categories:
•
•

Principal risks encompass all of the different types of risk to which Nationwide is exposed. These are defined in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, ensuring the
Society understands and manages all of its risks in a comprehensive and consistent way. Further information on these risks can be found on page 143 of the Risk report.
Top and emerging risks are specific current or future risks which have the potential to impact materially Nationwide’s financial results and delivery of its strategic objectives, and
often impact across a number of principal risks. The most significant of these are described below, together with key developments, a summary of actions we are taking to
reduce the risk, and the strategic objectives which are most likely to be impacted by each risk.

Top and emerging risks
Risk

How we mitigate this risk

C l i m at e c h an g e 
The risks relating to climate change, including both physical risks
to UK housing stock and property and the transitional risks as the
country moves towards zero net emissions, continue to evolve as
government policy develops and technologies mature.

•
•

We limit the impact our activities have on climate change by investing in
sustainable business practices and adjusting our lending criteria to
minimise risk.
We continue to develop our processes to reflect potential changes in
macro-economic conditions and the housing market as we transition to a
low carbon economy, and complete robust internal and external stress
testing for climate change.

Viability statement

Viability statement
The directors have an obligation to confirm that they believe that both the Society and the Group will be able to continue in operation, and to meet their
liabilities as they fall due. This viability statement considers the Group’s current financial and strategic position and the potential impact of its principal
risks, to explain the directors’ assessment of the Group’s prospects over an appropriate period.
Assessment of viability
In addition to taking a 12-month view of whether the Group remains a going concern, the directors have considered the viability of the Group over a three-year period. Whilst it will
always be difficult to predict the future path of the UK or the wider global economy with any degree of precision, this period strikes the right balance between assessing likely
outcomes using the current information we have, whilst accepting a degree of uncertainty over a longer period. A three-year period is within the timeframe of the Group’s
profitability projections and stress tests which provide a reasonable expectation of continued operations and ability to meet liabilities as they fall due.
In making their assessment, the directors have considered the Group’s key risks, and the stress testing activity which has been carried out to assess the potential impact of these
risks. This assessment includes consideration of the Top and emerging risks outlined in Risk overview. While there is an increased level of risk associated with regulatory change,
and technology and resilience, the impact of these risks to ongoing viability is low. When reviewed alongside the Group’s strategic plan, and the strength of the Group’s current
financial position, the directors conclude that the Group remains viable over a three-year period.
Consideration of key risks
The directors of Nationwide have considered for the purposes of viability over the past year the impact on Nationwide’s risk profile of the prevailing macroeconomic and
geopolitical environment, the changing needs of our customers and our work to ensure our processes and systems remain robust. While emerging risks on pages 65 to 66 were
not directly modelled, our assessment concluded that the severity and impact of these risks fall within the scenarios used for this analysis. Throughout the year, the Board has
considered the risks which are most relevant to Nationwide’s strategy, which include:
•

•
•
•
•

Geopolitical and macroeconomic environment – As a UK-focused business, the Group’s performance is naturally aligned to the UK’s economic conditions. The economic outlook
remains uncertain, having been severely impacted by the conflict in Ukraine and ongoing cost of living pressures. Whilst there remains uncertainty regarding the future profile of
interest rates and macroeconomic variables, the Society maintains strong capital and liquidity levels and regularly undertakes robust internal and regulatory stress tests to
ensure these are sufficient under a range of severe scenarios.
Competitive environment and consumer behaviours – The level of competition and brand relevance remains a key consideration. This could be driven by shifting customer
behaviours, regulatory changes and continued innovation in the financial services sector, or new participants using price and service advantage to challenge our market share
aspirations and profitability.
Economic crime and cyber security – We continuously monitor the external landscape to identify potential cyber and fraud threats whilst operating and maturing our economic
crime and cyber controls to protect our customers and services, and to meet our regulatory obligations.
Operational resilience – Maintaining resilient systems, infrastructure and processes remains critical as changing consumer behaviours influence member needs in accessing our
products and services and how they interact with us. We continue to monitor and strengthen our control environment whilst proactively monitoring the resilience of our services
to reduce disruption to our customers.
Climate change – Risks continue to evolve as government policies mature, including transition towards greater requirements on energy performance certificates (EPC) which is
likely to play out across a number of other risks.

Planning and stress testing activity during 2022/23
During 2022/23, the Group developed financial forecasts and a range of plausible stressed economic scenarios, which reflect the risks which are most material to our financial
strength. The scenarios considered include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

A base case economic scenario, reflecting weaker economic growth in the short term, a softening of momentum within the housing market and an increasing Bank rate. This
scenario has been subject to revision during the year to reflect developments in the macroeconomic outlook, in particular with respect to Bank rate and inflationary expectations.
A macroeconomic ‘downside’ sensitivity exploring the impacts of Bank rate falling rapidly back to 1% and greater deterioration in unemployment and house prices relative to the
base case scenario.
An internally generated stress scenario exploring a severe but plausible stress in which an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine causes an economic downturn, with rising
unemployment, inflation and substantial falls in house prices.
The Bank of England’s 2022 Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS), which considered a significant rise in inflation and the associated monetary policy impacts, causing Bank rate to rise.
The scenario anticipated a severe path for the current macroeconomic outlook, including a fall in real household income and a severe UK recession.
Our reverse stress test scenario, which explores the financial impact of Nationwide failing to deliver its strategic goals in a downside economic scenario, causing the loss of
brand, propositional and digital relevance and a failure to maintain scale.
A severe idiosyncratic liquidity stress scenario exploring the impact of a ransomware attack and resultant failure to maintain member confidence, in addition to the temporary
loss of access to wholesale funding markets, within the context of a macroeconomic stress.

A selection of these scenarios has been used for expected credit loss modelling during 2022/23, and further detail can be found in note 10 to the financial statements.
Conclusion on viability
In addition to the Group’s current financial strength, demonstrated through strong capital ratios (CET1 ratio of 26.5% and leverage ratio of 6.0% at 4 April 2023) and liquidity position
(12-month average LCR for the year ended 4 April 2023 of 180%), the directors have assessed the impact of the scenarios described above on the Group’s key financial metrics over
the three-year assessment period.
In our base case economic scenario, key financial performance metrics are projected to remain comfortably above Board Risk Appetite and regulatory buffers. In addition, our recent
external and internal stress testing activity demonstrates how the Group can withstand severe economic and competitive stresses, including those linked to an escalation of the
conflict in Ukraine, heightened inflation and changes to the expected path of Bank rate.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Society and Group will be able to continue its operations, and to meet its liabilities as they fall due, over the three-year
assessment period.

Financial review
Chris Rhodes, Chief Financial Officer, Nationwide Building Society, said:
“The sustained strength of our finances has allowed us to support our members through a highly uncertain period
and significant cost of living increases. It has also enabled the Society to launch the Nationwide Fairer Share
Payment in June 2023, returning £340 million directly to our eligible members, as well as a Fairer Share Bond.

Chris
Rhodes

“We have continued to support our members’ borrowing and savings needs during the year, and as a result have
delivered growth in our mortgage and deposit balances. We delivered £1,055 million of member financial benefit
through better pricing and incentives than the market average during the year. We also provided £57 million of
cashback to customers who hold a current account with us and £40 million of additional cost of living support to
colleagues.
“Due to the highly uncertain economic outlook, it is important that we maintain our financial strength to continue to
support our customers through the challenges ahead.”

Financial highlights
•

•

•

•

Underlying profit for the year increased to
£2,233 million (2022: £1,604 million) and statutory
profit increased to £2,229 million (2022: £1,597
million). This reflects income growth, partially offset
by higher costs and charges for credit impairments.
Total income increased by £806 million due to rising
interest rates, with net interest margin (NIM)
increasing to 1.57% (2022: 1.26%).
Member financial benefit increased to £1,055 million
(2022: £325 million), supported by the strength of our
mortgage and savings rates relative to the market
average.
Mortgage balances increased to £201.7 billion (2022:
£198.1 billion), resulting in a stock market share of
12.2% (2022: 12.4%). Member deposit balances
increased by £9.1 billion to £187.1 billion (2022:
£178.0 billion) and our market share of deposits
increased to 9.6% (2022: 9.4%).

•

•

•

Total administrative expenses increased by
£89 million to £2,323 million (2022: £2,234 million),
reflecting higher inflation, including £40 million
relating to cost of living support to colleagues.
The credit impairment charge of £126 million for the
year (2022: release of £27 million) reflects a
deterioration in the economic outlook during the year,
with expected future increases in arrears due to
affordability pressures. However, the credit quality of
our lending portfolios remains very strong with low
levels of arrears.

Member financial benefit
As a building society, we seek to maintain Nationwide’s financial strength whilst providing value to our members through pricing, products and service. Through member financial
benefit, we measure the additional financial value for members from the competitive mortgage, savings and banking products that we offer compared to the market average.
Member financial benefit is calculated by comparing, in aggregate, Nationwide’s average interest rates and incentives to the market, predominantly using market data provided by
the Bank of England and CACI, alongside internal calculations. The value for individual members will depend on their circumstances and product choices.
We quantify member financial benefit as:
Our interest rate differential + incentives and lower fees

Interest rate differential
We measure how our average interest rates across our member balances in total compare against the market over the year.
For our two largest member segments, mortgages and retail deposits, we compare the average member interest rate for these portfolios against Bank of England and CACI industry
data. A market benchmark based upon the data from CACI and internal Nationwide calculations is used for mortgages and a Bank of England benchmark is used for retail deposits,
both adjusted to exclude Nationwide balances. The differentials derived in this way are then applied to member balances for mortgages and deposits.
For unsecured lending, a similar comparison is made. We calculate an interest rate differential based on available market data from the Bank of England and CACI and apply this to
the total interest bearing balances of credit cards and personal loans.

Member incentives and fees
Our member financial benefit measure also includes amounts in relation to incentives and fees that Nationwide offers to members. The calculation includes annual amounts for the
following:
•
•
•

Mortgages: the differential on incentives for members compared to the market.
FlexPlus account: this current account is considered market leading against major banking competitors, with a high level of benefits for a relatively smaller fee. The difference
between the monthly account fee of £13 and the market average over the financial year of £20 is included in the member financial benefit measure.
Member Prize Draw: eligible members were automatically entered into monthly prize draws with a total prize pot of £1 million. The prize draw was launched in September 2021
and ran until August 2022.

For the year ended 4 April 2023, this measure shows we provided our members with a financial benefit of £1,055 million (2022: £325 million). The increase is due to our strong
mortgage and savings products which seek to provide good value to members. As interest rates have risen, we have passed through a higher proportion of the increase to savers
than the market average. The member financial benefit of £1,055 million does not include the Nationwide Fairer Share Payment to be made in June 2023.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses have increased by £89 million to £2,323 million (2022: £2,234 million) largely due to inflation. The costs in the year include £40 million cost of living support
to employees. Costs also include incremental investment in financial crime controls of £16 million and in technology resilience, particularly £26 million relating to payment systems.
Redundancy and associated costs have increased by £32 million as we create efficiencies within our support functions. These amounts were offset by the non-recurrence of 2022
charges relating to accelerated amortisation of specific intangible assets of £53 million and historical fraud cases of £16 million.

Note:
i. Impairment charge/(release) represents the net amount charged/(credited) through the income statement, rather than amounts written off during the year.

The net impairment charge for the year of £126 million (2022: release of £27 million) includes the impact of higher expected interest rates on mortgage provisions. The prior year
impairment release reflected a decrease in provisions during a year where the economic outlook had improved. The underlying arrears performance of our residential mortgage
portfolio has improved slightly, with consumer lending arrears marginally deteriorating. An increase in arrears from current levels is expected due to affordability pressures. More
information regarding critical accounting judgements, and the forward-looking economic information used in impairment calculations, is included in note 10 to the financial
statements.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are held to cover the costs of remediation and redress in relation to historical quality control procedures, past sales and administration of customer accounts, and other
regulatory matters. The release of £9 million (2022: £56 million charge) is due to updates to judgements and estimates used in determining provisions relating to historical quality
control procedures. More information is included in note 27 to the financial statements.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of £565 million (2022: £345 million) represents an effective tax rate of 25.4% (2022: 21.6%) which is higher than the statutory UK corporation tax rate of
19% (2022: 19%). The effective tax rate is higher primarily due to the banking surcharge of £145 million (2022: £72 million). The effective tax rate in 2022 was also reduced by the
impact of £23 million of non-recurring tax adjustments in respect of prior years. Further information is provided in note 11 to the financial statements.

Balance sheet
Total assets have decreased to £271.9 billion at 4 April 2023 (2022: £272.4 billion). This is predominantly due to reduced holdings of cash and liquid assets.
Mortgage lending has been robust, with residential mortgage balances increasing to £201.7 billion (2022: £198.1 billion). Member deposit balances have increased by £9.1 billion to
£187.1 billion (2022: £178.0 billion) as a result of increases in savings balances following the launch of competitive new products.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
(note ii):

(2022: 183%)

Notes:
i. Residential mortgages include prime, buy to let and legacy lending.
ii. This represents a simple average of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for the last 12 month ends. The LCR ensures that sufficient high-quality liquid assets are held to survive a short-term
severe but plausible liquidity stress.
iii. Included within other non-financial assets at 4 April 2023 is £24 million (2022: £18 million) of inventory in relation to the construction of houses at the Oakfield development in Swindon.

Cash
Cash is liquidity held by our Treasury function, with the £4.6 billion decrease predominantly due to a £4.5 billion repayment of the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme with
additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME).
The average Liquidity Coverage Ratio over the 12 months ended 4 April 2023 was 180% (12 months ended 4 April 2022: 183%). Liquidity continues to be managed against internal
risk appetite, which is more prudent than regulatory requirements and, under the most severe internal 30 calendar day stress test, the average liquid asset buffer remains robust.
Nationwide’s liquidity and funding risk framework also ensures that a stable and diverse funding base is maintained. Further details are included in the Liquidity and funding risk
section of the Risk report.

Residential mortgages
Total gross mortgage lending was lower than in the prior year at £33.6 billion (2022: £36.5 billion) and our market share of gross advances decreased to 10.8% (2022: 11.8%). Net
lending in the year was supported by our continued focus on retention through highly competitive products provided to existing members, whilst also continuing to focus on first
time buyers. Prime mortgage balances increased to £157.6 billion (2022: £154.4 billion) and buy to let and legacy mortgage balances increased to £44.1 billion (2022: £43.7 billion).
Arrears remain low and have improved slightly during the year, with cases more than three months in arrears representing 0.32% (2022: 0.34%) of the total portfolio. However, an
increase in arrears from current levels is expected, due to rising inflation and increasing interest rates negatively impacting household finances. Impairment provision balances have
increased to £280 million (2022: £187 million) primarily due to higher interest rate expectations. This has resulted in an increase in the provisions held to reflect mortgage
affordability risks, as well as increased expected credit losses in the severe downside economic scenario.
Consumer banking
Consumer banking balances have decreased to £4.4 billion (2022: £4.6 billion). Consumer banking comprises personal loan balances of £2.6 billion (2022: £2.9 billion), credit card
balances of £1.5 billion (2022: £1.5 billion) and overdrawn current account balances of £0.3 billion (2022: £0.3 billion).
Arrears performance has deteriorated slightly during the year, with balances more than three months in arrears (excluding charged off accounts) representing 1.21% (2022: 1.13%) of
the total portfolio. Provision balances were £469 million (2022: £529 million), primarily due to revised impacts of affordability pressures on future credit performance.
Commercial lending
During the year, commercial lending balances decreased to £5.5 billion (2022: £6.1 billion). The overall portfolio includes registered social landlords with balances of £4.1 billion
(2022: £4.3 billion), project finance with balances of £0.5 billion (2022: £0.6 billion) and commercial real estate balances of £0.4 billion (2022: £0.6 billion). Both project finance and
commercial real estate books are closed to new lending.
Impairment provision balances decreased to £16 million (2022: £30 million) due to updates to a small number of individual loans.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets of £32.4 billion (2022: £30.8 billion) comprise investment assets held by Nationwide’s Treasury function of £27.6 billion (2022: £25.5 billion), loans and
advances to banks and similar institutions of £2.9 billion (2022: £3.0 billion), derivatives with positive fair values of £6.9 billion (2022: £4.7 billion) and fair value adjustments for
portfolio hedged risk of £(5.0) billion (2022: £(2.4) billion). Derivatives largely comprise interest rate and foreign exchange contracts which economically hedge financial risks
inherent in Nationwide’s lending and funding activities.

Capital structure
Nationwide’s capital position remains strong, with both the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio and leverage ratio comfortably above regulatory capital requirements of 11.5% and
4.0% respectively. The CET1 ratio increased to 26.5% (2022: 24.1%) and the leverage ratio increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.4%). The capital disclosures included in this report are in line
with UK Capital Requirements Directive V (UK CRD V) with IFRS 9 transitional arrangements included.

The CET1 ratio increased to 26.5% (2022: 24.1%) as a result of an increase in CET1 capital of £1.3 billion, in conjunction with a reduction in RWAs of £0.1 billion. The CET1 capital
resources increase was driven by £1.7 billion profit after tax, partially offset by £0.2 billion of capital distributions, a £0.1 billion CET1 deduction following the repurchase of Core
Capital Deferred Shares (CCDS) in February 2023, and a £0.1 billion reduction in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve. RWAs reduced, with an increase in
residential mortgage lending being more than offset by a reduction in off-balance sheet commitments.
The leverage ratio increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.4%), with Tier 1 capital increasing by £1.3 billion as a result of the CET1 capital movements referenced above. In addition, there was a
decrease in leverage exposure of £6.1 billion, driven by the same movements as described above for RWAs. Leverage requirements continue to be Nationwide’s binding Tier 1
capital constraint, as the combination of minimum and regulatory buffer requirements are in excess of the risk-based equivalent.
Further details of the capital position and future regulatory developments are described in the Capital risk section of the Risk report.

Board leadership and Society purpose
The role of the Board
Nationwide’s Board ensures that the Society’s long-term
strategy is implemented within a good quality governance
framework to enable it to continue to deliver the benefits of
mutuality to its members. More information on the Society’s
purpose, the business model and how the Society generates
and preserves value over the long term can be found on pages
4 to 8.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Society is
sustainable and delivers long-term value for its members. It
determines the Society’s strategic objectives within a
framework of risk appetite and controls. The Board monitors
the Society’s overall financial performance and ensures effective
governance, controls and risk management.
When setting the Society’s strategy, the Board considers the
impact that its decisions might have on various stakeholders
such as members, customers, colleagues, suppliers and the wider
community. It is accountable for ensuring that, as a collective
body, it has the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience to
perform its role effectively. The Board is also responsible for
providing leadership to the Society on culture, values and
ethics. The powers of the Board are set out in the Society’s
Memorandum and Rules which are available on the Society’s
website nationwide.co.uk

the Board receives updates from management. Over the last 12
months, culture has been assessed and monitored through
internal surveys and external reviews, supported by the
Financial Services Culture Board (FSCB) and Ipsos Karin & Box.
Looking ahead, the Society is strengthening its relationship with
Ipsos Karin & Box to replace FSCB’s external benchmarking, and
to align the culture assessment approach with the refreshed
strategy through measurement of critical behaviours.
The reviews throughout the year have shown colleagues
continue to be deeply connected to the Society’s purpose and
values, recognising its strong ethic of care and mutuality.
The Board has an appointed non-executive director with specific
responsibilities for the Employee Voice in the boardroom. This
role is currently held by Tamara Rajah.
The Board will continue to sponsor and monitor progress in all
areas of our culture in the coming year.

Phil Rivett is the Whistleblowers’ Champion and responsible for
ensuring and overseeing the integrity, independence and
effectiveness of Nationwide’s policies and procedures relating to
whistleblowing, including those intended to protect
whistleblowers from being victimised because they have
disclosed reportable concerns.
The Board recognises that having effective and trusted
confidential whistleblowing arrangements is key in supporting
the Society’s open and honest culture. The Board receives an
Annual Whistleblowing Report and has reviewed the adequacy
and effectiveness of the arrangements in place for the
proportionate and independent investigation of concerns raised,
including any required follow-up action taken. During 2022, a
total of 214 concerns were raised of which 103 were formally
investigated as whistleblowing (2021: 182 concerns raised of
which 94 were investigated as whistleblowing). The remainder
were investigated utilising other internal resources.

Whistleblowing

contractors and temporary workers to raise concerns about
possible misconduct, wrongdoing and behaviour towards others
by its employees and third parties, including those related to
non-financial matters. Concerns can be raised confidentially or

Governance at Nationwide (continued)

Tracey Graham joined the Board in
September 2022 and shares her insights
Tracey Graham will be seeking election as a non-executive director at our AGM in July 2023 and will become the Senior
Independent Director, subject to regulatory approval, following Gunn Waersted’’s retirement from the Board.
What are your first impressions of Nationwide?
So overwhelmingly positive! Nationwide is a pre-eminent trusted brand and is owned by and run for the benefit of members. This mutual status ensures it has a strategic focus on its members and
other customers. Every single Nationwide colleague that I have met is focused on delivering market leading customer service. People are rightly proud to work for Nationwide, with its unique
heritage and ability to be a force for mutual good and making a positive contribution to wider society.
What do you bring to Nationwide, its Board and its members?
I have first-hand experience of serving on a mutual board, having served nine years (the maximum term) on the board of the UK's largest mutual insurance company, standing down just before I
joined Nationwide. I also have broad financial services experience having undertaken senior banking and insurance executive roles and have experience of listed company and mutual boards, across
a range of sectors, including financial and business sectors which is very relevant to Nationwide. I am a former CEO, and bring commercial, operational and customer services experience. I also have
extensive experience as a Remuneration Committee Chair in listed and regulated companies and have served on all types of board committees, this experience being incredibly valuable as I chair
Nationwide's Remuneration Committee. I have also been a member of Nationwide for more than 20 years, so have personally valued its commitment to customer service and to the mutual model.
What do you think are Nationwide’’s main challenges and opportunities?
I have already referred to Nationwide's pre-eminent respected and trusted brand, meaning Nationwide operates from a position of significant strength. The Society has a strong capital position, and
leading market position, with a committed membership. These foundations mean we build from a position of strength. Of course, there will be opportunities and challenges ahead with potential
new market entrants, technological enhancements and developments, or disruption to traditional business models. However, Nationwide's relentless commitment to operational excellence and
customer service are the foundations for its future success.

Time commitment

Director independence

To discharge their responsibilities effectively, nonexecutive directors must commit sufficient time to their
role. The time the non-executive directors are expected
to commit to their role at Nationwide is agreed
individually, as part of the appointment process, and
depends upon their responsibilities. For example,
additional time commitment will often be required of
the Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs
to fulfil their extra responsibilities. The Chairman and
non-executive directors are expected to allocate
sufficient time to understand the business, through
meetings with management and undergoing training to
ensure ongoing development. The Chairman and nonexecutive directors are also expected to attend meetings
with the Society’s regulators to foster and maintain an
open and transparent working relationship. This time is
in addition to that spent preparing for, and attending,
Board and Board committee meetings. Time
commitments are reviewed annually, or more regularly if
needed, as Nationwide recognises the need to take
account of changes in best practice. Non-executive
directors are expected to commit a minimum of 30 days
per year for core activities and membership of Board
committees. The Senior Independent Director and
Committee Chairs are expected to commit a minimum
of 50-60 days per year.. The Chairman will, on average,
spend a minimum of 2 days per week on Nationwide
business. The Chairman has confirmed with each nonexecutive director that they have been able to allocate
sufficient time to fulfilling their duties this year..

The Nomination and Governance Committee considers
the independence of each non-executive director on an
annual basis. In reaching its determination of
independence, the Committee considers factors such as
length of tenure and relationships or circumstances
which are likely to affect or appear to affect the director’s
judgement. On the recommendation of the Committee,
all non-executive directors have been assessed by the
Board to be independent as to character and judgement
and to be free of relationships and other circumstances
which could materially affect the exercise of their
judgement.

Externally, there has been no increase in the Chairman’s
other significant commitments during the year which
would impact his time commitment to fulfil his duties.
During the year, and on the recommendation of the
Nomination and Governance Committee, the Board
approved the additional external appointment of Albert
Hitchcock as a non-executive director of Pureprofile
Limited as the appointment was not considered to impair
his ability to serve as a director of Nationwide.

92

Prior to his appointment to the Board, Alan Keir was a
member of senior management and then served as a
non-executive director of HSBC UK. The Society has an
agency banking contract with HSBC and all incoming
and outgoing international and domestic CHAPs
payments are routed through HSBC. The Committee
continues to be satisfied that his previous business
relationship with HSBC does not impact his
independence or ability to carry out his role as a nonexecutive director of the Society.
All eligible directors (save for Mai Fyfield and Gunn
Waersted who will be retiring from the Board) will be
recommended to members for election or re-election at
the AGM in July 2023.

Information and advice
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant
information to enable it to perform its duties effectively.
The Society Secretary ensures appropriate and timely
information flows between the Board, its committees and
senior management, enabling the Board to exercise its
judgement and make fully informed decisions when
discharging its duties.

Report of the directors on corporate governance (continued)
Governance at Nationwide (continued)

The Society Secretary supports the Chairman in setting
the Board agenda. Board papers are distributed to all
directors in advance of Board meetings via a secure
electronic system allowing directors to access
information in a timely manner. Regular management
updates are sent to directors to keep them informed of
events between formal board meetings and to ensure
that they are advised of the latest issues affecting the
Society.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Society Secretary, who is responsible for advising the
Board through the Society Chairman on all governance
matters and for ensuring that Board procedures are
followed and compliance with applicable rules and
regulations is observed. The directors may, if required,
take independent professional advice at the Society’s
expense.

Induction, training, and development
Following appointment, directors receive a full and
formal bespoke induction to familiarise them with their
duties and the Society’s business operations, and risk
and governance arrangements. Inductions are tailored to
each director’s individual experience, background and
areas of focus and are set alongside their broader
individual development plan. The induction programme
includes meetings with senior management.
The Chairman, with support from the Society Secretary,
has overall responsibility for ensuring that the directors
receive suitable training to enable them to carry out their
duties. The directors are provided with the opportunity
for ongoing training and professional development to
ensure they have the necessary knowledge and
understanding of the Society’s business. Training can be
provided through meetings, presentations, and briefings
by internal and external advisers.

Governance at Nationwide (continued)

Report of the directors on corporate governance (continued)
Directors are encouraged to update their professional skills
and knowledge of the business continually, and to identify
any additional training requirements that would assist
them in carrying out their role. Where individual directors
have requested, individual training sessions have been
held with subject matter experts.
The Chairman has conversations with each non-executive
director on a regular basis during the year and at the end
of the year to review performance and development needs.
The Senior Independent Director is responsible for the
evaluation of the Chairman’s performance and
development needs. Executive directors undertake
performance reviews as part of the Society’s annual
performance management cycle.

Composition, succession, and evaluation
Board composition
The Nomination and Governance Committee is responsible for
reviewing Board composition, considering succession plans
for both the Board and senior executives, selecting and
appointing new directors and considering the results of the
Board effectiveness review. More information on the work of this
Committee can be found on pages 110 to 113.
To maintain a balanced Board, the skills and experience of
individual Board members are regularly reviewed. Ensuring the
right mix of director competencies is vital for constructive
discussion and, ultimately, effective Board decisions. The individual
biographies of the directors, which include their relevant skills
and experience, can be found on pages 79 to 82.

All directors are subject to conduct rules laid down by regulators
and must satisfy requirements relating to their fitness and propriety.
In addition, the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and
Committee Chairs are subject to all aspects of the Senior
Managers Regime.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment
for the Chairman and non-executive directors are available for
inspection at the Society’s principal office and will be available
at the AGM.

Board tenure

However, in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the Code), all directors of Nationwide are subject to election or
re-election by the members annually. Before re-election, a
non-executive director will be subject to a review of that director’s
continued effectiveness and independence.

Member nominations
Members of Nationwide have the right to nominate candidates
for election to the Board, subject to the Society’s Memorandum
and Rules and compliance with PRA and FCA requirements.
No such nominations had been received by 4 April 2023, this
being the deadline for election to the Board at the 2023 AGM.

The Society’s Memorandum and Rules require that Board directors
must be re-elected by the Society’s membership every three years.

Composition, succession, and evaluation (continued)
The information below is provided in compliance with new reporting requirements under the Listing Rules, which apply to accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2022. These requirements,
require the Society to disclose in its Annual Report certain diversity metrics relating to the composition of its Board and executive management, as well as its performance against three diversity
targets that have been set by the FCA.
The information below is provided as at 4 April 2023 and confirms that the Society has met all of the following targets on board diversity: (1) at least 40% of its board of directors are women; (2) at
least one of its most senior positions on the Board is held by a woman; and (3) at least one individual on the Board is from a minority ethnic background. In the case of the first and second targets,
these have been exceeded, with women representing 58% of the Society’s Board and both the roles of Chief Executive and the Senior Independent Director (SID) being held by women. Information
on gender/sex and ethnicity is collected from executive management at the application stage of their recruitment. Information on gender/sex is collected from Board members at the onboarding
stage of their recruitment. Information on Board members’ ethnicity is collected post appointment by the Society Secretary.
The Board’s Diversity Statement is set out in the Board Composition and Succession Policy which can be found on the Society’s website: nationwide.co.uk and provides guidance on the
identification and selection of suitable candidates for appointment to the Board and its committees. The Board is committed to ensuring that it comprises a membership which is diverse and
reflects the Nationwide members that it represents. It aims to achieve this by ensuring representation within the Board of race, age, gender, disability and sexuality in addition to appropriate socioeconomic educational and professional backgrounds. Selecting the best candidate is paramount and all appointments are based on merit and objective criteria with due regard for the benefits of
diversity on the Board. This benefits the effectiveness of the Board by creating diversity of thought and breadth of perspective among our directors. The Nomination and Governance Committee
Report on pages 110 to 113 sets out the selection process for new non-executive directors appointed during the year and states how the Board plans to maintain its effectiveness by ensuring that it
has a diverse membership going forward.

2022 Board performance review

The Society Chairman’s performance review was led by the
Senior Independent Director on behalf of the Board in May
2022. This review included peer feedback from the nonexecutive and executive directors. The review concluded that
the Society Chairman continued to perform effectively,
remained fit and proper to perform the role, upheld his
regulatory responsibilities, and demonstrated commitment to
his role. In light of this conclusion, the election of Kevin Parry
as Society Chairman was put to members at the 2022 AGM in
July 2022, where he was elected.

The UK Corporate Governance Code and the Financial Reporting
Council (FRC) Guidance on Board Effectiveness require boards
undergo an externally facilitated review at least every three
years. Lintstock Limited was engaged by the Society for a threeyear programme to support the Board performance reviews in
2021 to 2023, the process for which is outlined below.

Individual director performance
A review of the performance and contribution of each director
was conducted by the Society Chairman to ensure that all
directors contributed effectively to the good governance of
Nationwide. This is one of the factors considered when
deciding whether individual directors will offer themselves for
election or re-election at the Society’s AGM. The reviews
concluded that each director continued to perform effectively
and demonstrated commitment to the role. During the year,
the Society Chairman met each director individually to discuss
their personal performance and establish whether each
director continued to contribute effectively to the long-term
success of the Society.
Board performance
The Board conducts an annual review of its performance which
is a key mechanism for ensuring that it continues to operate
effectively and for setting objectives and development areas for
the forthcoming year. This annual review is conducted through
a formal evaluation and considers the work of individual
directors, the Board and its committees.

The scope of the 2022 Board evaluation was determined at the
November 2021 Nomination and Governance Committee with
approval given by the Board. The scope was determined
following review of the 2021 effectiveness responses and
agreeing which areas required focus. It covered general areas of
effectiveness including: the strengths and capabilities of the
Board and each of its principal committees; evaluation of
individual Board members; Board composition and succession
planning; Boardroom dynamics; and the effectiveness of the
Board’s relationship with principal executive stakeholders.

The key findings were captured in a review document that was
submitted and presented to the Board by Lintstock Limited in
May 2022.
The outcomes of the review are reported below, highlighting
further areas of focus and development that were identified
during the process, as well as identifying the strengths that
could continue to be optimised. Overall, the findings endorsed
the belief that the Board and its committees are performing and
operating effectively, with directors satisfied with the
performance and effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
The Board will continue to make progress against the key
findings of the review, challenge management on execution and
delivery, and ensure that time is devoted to Board composition
and succession planning.

receive input from key stakeholders with direct involvement and
reporting to the Board, including members of the Executive
Committee.
The review consisted of questionnaires sent to all Board
members, the General Counsel, the Society Secretary and other
relevant key senior stakeholders for each of the Board’s principal
committees. The questionnaire covered general areas of
effectiveness, as well as considering the Board’s decision-making
processes and stakeholder oversight. Individual committee
questionnaires were also completed by the relevant committee
members and other key stakeholders where appropriate.

Audit, risk and internal control
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent
of the risks the Society is willing to take to achieve its long-term
strategic objectives. This is detailed in the Society’s Risk Appetite
Statement. The Board is responsible for ensuring that
management maintains an effective system of risk management
and internal control and for assessing its effectiveness.

The ERMF is supported by a system of internal controls and
processes. These systems and processes are designed to
manage, not eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors the Society’s risk management and internal
control systems and carries out an annual review of their

Internal control over financial reporting
The Society’s financial reporting process has been designed to
provide assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and preparation of financial statements, as well as consolidated
financial statements, in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Internal controls and risk management systems are in place to
provide assurance over the preparation of the financial
statements. These include independent testing of the critical
financial reporting processes and controls, from data origination
to reporting, to an agreed level aligned to the Society’s Board
Risk Appetite. The result of this assurance work is reported to
control owners and the Chief Financial Officer, with a summary
report presented to the Audit Committee. Financial information
submitted for inclusion in the financial statements is attested by
individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

The Annual Report and Accounts are scrutinised throughout the
financial reporting process by relevant senior stakeholders before
being submitted to the Audit Committee, which provide
challenge, before recommending to the Board for approval.
The Audit Committee also discusses control conclusions and
recommendations arising from the audit with the external
auditor.
Aspects of internal control over financial reporting have also been
reviewed by Internal Audit. Based on the various reviews and
reports provided to the Audit Committee, it was concluded that
the controls over financial reporting are effective.
More information on the Society’s risk management and internal
control systems can be found on pages 65 to 66 of the
Governance report and on pages 139 to 143 of the Risk report.

Remuneration
The Board is responsible for determining the Society’s remuneration policies and practices, including executive and senior management remuneration. Information on the work of the Board’s
Remuneration Committee and the Report of the directors on remuneration can be found on pages 114 to 134.

satisfied that the ERMF is appropriate, whilst recognising that
some internal controls could be matured.

Audit Committee
report
Dear fellow member,
I am pleased to report on the work of the Audit Committee during the financial year ended 4 April 2023.
Throughout another busy year, the Committee has continued to play a key role on behalf of the Board to challenge and monitor the
integrity of the Society’s financial reporting and to oversee its financial controls. The Committee has scrutinised the Society’s half and
full year results and has reviewed the significant financial reporting judgements made therein, as well as the accounting policies
adopted. In addition, the Committee reviewed and provided challenge to the Society’s climate-related disclosures and ensured that the
Society challenged itself appropriately in respect of its science-based emissions targets.
The Committee oversees and reviews the Society’s internal financial controls and internal controls systems. Such controls are designed
to ensure that the Society mitigates its risks and keeps its customers’ money safe. The Committee oversees and challenges the work
undertaken by Internal Audit to ensure that the Society’s controls and processes have appropriate oversight, with particular focus
having been given to the prompt and effective resolution of issues raised by Internal Audit.
The Committee continues to monitor external factors to ensure that the Society’s reporting and controls take into consideration, and
appropriately respond to, emerging developments and external risks. During the year, this has included consideration of the proposed
reforms to the UK’s corporate governance and audit regimes, commonly referred to as ‘UK SOX’, and the impact of the higher cost of
living on our members’ personal and household budgets.
During the year, the Committee has overseen the work undertaken by the Society’s external auditors, Ernst & Young (EY), which
included reviewing EY’s effectiveness, independence and objectivity. This review took into consideration all relevant UK
professional and regulatory requirements. As Chair of the Audit Committee, I support the re-election of EY by members at our
AGM in July 2023 and direct members to further information on the work of EY that can be found on pages 220 to 233.

How the Committee works
The membership of the Committee comprises at least three
independent non-executive directors who bring a diverse
range of experience in business, finance, auditing, risk and
controls, with particular depth of experience in the financial
services sector. The qualifications and experience of each
member of the Committee are included in their biographies
on pages 79 to 82.
In addition to Committee members, regular attendees of
Committee meetings included the Society Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Financial Officer,
Chief Risk Officer and representatives of the Society’s external
auditors, EY.
The Board is satisfied that the Committee possesses recent
and relevant financial experience and accounting competence,
and that the Committee as a whole is appropriately competent
in the sector in which the Society operates. The Committee
also draws on the expertise of key advisers and control
functions, including the internal and external auditors.

Subject matter experts are invited to meetings to present on
particular topics. The Committee provides oversight and
advice to the Board on the matters listed in its terms of
reference (available at nationwide.co.uk) and reports to the
Board on those matters after each meeting.
The Committee held seven scheduled meetings during the
year, and additionally held two joint meetings with the Board
Risk Committee to consider matters of common interest. The
attendance record of Committee members is set out on page
83.
During the year, the Committee met privately with the Chief
Internal Auditor, the Society’s external auditors and the Chief
Risk Officer, without management present. Additionally, a
private meeting was held with the Head of Economic Crime.
The Chair of the Committee also attended meetings with the
PRA, including a tripartite meeting with EY. The effectiveness
of the Committee is reviewed annually, along with the
Committee’s terms of reference and its activities over the
previous year.

The purpose of this review is to confirm that the terms of
reference align with the Committee’s remit and purpose, and
continue to reflect all applicable governance codes, guidelines,
legislation and best practice. In 2022, the effectiveness review
was undertaken by the Society’s Secretariat function with the
assistance of Lintstock Limited, as part of the three-year Board
and committee effectiveness review process agreed in 2021.
Feedback on the Committee’s performance and effectiveness
was provided to both the Committee and the Board. The results
of the review indicate that Committee members are satisfied
with the performance and effectiveness of the Committee. The
2022 effectiveness review, including actions and next steps, is
described on pages 97 to 98.
The Committee provides input to the Remuneration Committee
to assist that committee in its assessment of possible impacts
on variable remuneration. This input is provided in conjunction
with the Board Risk Committee.

What the Committee did in the year
Financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
The Committee scrutinised the Annual Report and Accounts, Preliminary Results Announcement and the Interim Results and was satisfied that the reporting, including the disclosures in the notes
to the accounts, fairly represented the Society’s results and business performance. It considered these documents against ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ principles and whether the reporting
reflected the Society’s strategy. It further considered whether the impacts of the increases to the cost of living, the conflict in Ukraine and recent banking events were properly assessed, in particular
within impairment provisions, and appropriately recognised and disclosed.
The Committee discussed and challenged management’s analyses, the external auditor’s work, and conclusions on the main areas of judgement presented in the Annual Report and Accounts. The
Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial reporting systems are in place to provide assurance over the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts, and that financial
information submitted for inclusion in the financial statements is attested by individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience. Key internal controls used to process transactions are subject
to regular testing, the results of which are reported to the Committee.
The significant judgements in relation to the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts for 2022/23 are noted below as areas of focus and were discussed with management and the external
auditor during the year.

Going concern and viability statement
The going concern statement is included in the Directors’ report on page 137 and the viability statement is included in the Strategic report on pages 67 to 68.
The Committee reviewed the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements and the viability statement for recommendation to the Board for approval. It assessed, together with the
Board Risk Committee, the levels of capital and availability of funding and liquidity, together with outputs of stress tests and reverse stress tests. The Committee also considered risks from business
activities, technology change and economic factors such as the continued impacts of rising interest rates, inflation and the Ukraine conflict, which may affect the Society’s future development,
performance and financial position, together with the implications of principal risks including operational resilience and cyber security. In addition, the Committee considered whether a period
longer than three years should be covered in the viability statement, concluding that, as in the prior year, a period of three years was appropriate, particularly when taking into account changes in
the economic, technological, and regulatory environment.
Based on its review, the Committee concluded that the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements remained appropriate and recommended the approval of the
viability statement to the Board.

Accounting policies and judgements
The Committee reviewed the Society’s accounting policies and
processes and confirmed they were appropriate to be used in
the financial statements. Areas of key judgement made in
preparation of the financial statements considered by the
Committee are set out within this report.
The Committee noted that there were no new accounting
standards, or amendments to standards, effective for the
reporting period which had a significant impact for the
Group.

Alternative performance measures and disclosure
of member financial benefit
The Committee continues to consider that certain non-GAAP
measures, such as underlying profit, aid an understanding of
the Society’s results. The Committee considered the
disclosure of, and prominence given to, underlying profit to
be appropriate.

The other performance measure considered carefully by the
Committee was the value for member financial benefit presented
in Nationwide’s financial reporting. This metric estimates the
benefit provided to members in the form of differentiated pricing
and incentives, representing Nationwide’s interest rate
differential, lower fees and higher member incentives compared
with market averages and was considered a key performance
indicator during the year. The Committee was satisfied with the
approach to the measurement of member financial benefit and
the associated disclosure. Details of member financial benefit
are shown on page 71.

Climate change risk and related disclosures
Disclosures are set out on pages 53 to 64 of the Strategic
report. The Committee discussed with management the
continued development of disclosures regarding climate
change risks and impacts.

The Committee reviewed the Report on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures which is published on the Society’s
website nationwide.co.uk and the summary of those
disclosures presented in the Annual Report and Accounts. A
particular focus during the year was on the transparency of
disclosure of the challenges in working towards net-zero and
ensuring that the Society challenged itself appropriately with
regard to the establishment of its science-based emissions
targets. The Committee also considered management’s
evaluation of the potential impact of climate change on the
financial statements, concurring with management’s
conclusion that the main area of future risk was impairment
provisions on prime and buy-to-let mortgages, although
ongoing monitoring would be required of areas such as
property valuation and pension scheme investments, and that
there was no material impact at 4 April 2023.

Significant financial reporting issues and accounting judgements considered by the Committee during the year
In compiling a set of financial statements, it is necessary to make estimates and judgements about outcomes that are typically dependent on future events. Significant matters are set out below.
Area of focus

Committee response

Impairment
provisions for loan
portfolios and
related disclosures

Given the significance of Nationwide’s loan portfolios, understanding the Society’s exposure to credit risk and ensuring that impairment provisions are appropriate
remain key priorities for the Committee. Significant judgements were made during the year, in particular in respect of the continuing uncertainty in the economic
outlook and the impacts of increasing inflation and rising interest rates on affordability.

Information on credit
risk and assumptions
relating to expected
credit losses is
included in note 10 to
the financial
statements

The selection of, and probabilities applied to, a range of economic scenarios for the purpose of modelling expected credit losses continue to have a material impact on
loan loss provisions. The Committee challenged management to demonstrate that provisions appropriately reflected economic conditions, taking into account increases
in interest rates and inflation, and the outlook for unemployment and house prices, as well as the ongoing uncertainty in relation to the global economic consequences of
the conflict in Ukraine. Discussions took into account contemporary economic data and management’s forward-looking view of the economy. Following detailed review
and discussion, assumptions for base case, upside and downside scenarios, as well as for a severe economic downturn, were agreed. The Committee concurred with
management that the scenarios used reflected an appropriate range of assumptions. Following discussion, scenario probability weights were updated to reflect the
changing economic outlook such that at the year end the upside scenario weight was 10%, base case scenario 45%, downside scenario 30% and the severe downside
scenario 15%.

(continued)

At the year end, the level of estimation uncertainty continued to be heightened by the continued level of uncertainty in the economic outlook. The Committee challenged
management to demonstrate that all relevant risks had been taken into account in the expected credit loss models, and that model adjustments that rely on expert
judgement were recognised where appropriate, including for tail risks which could not be modelled due to an absence of historical data. A key area of focus was the
increased credit risk associated with affordability pressures on borrowers generally due to rising interest rates and increased inflation. This included reviewing
management’s assessment of the impacts of the payment shock that would be experienced by residential mortgage borrowers whose fixed rates would expire in the near
term. The methodology used assessed the impact of increased interest rates and inflation on members’ disposable monthly income. In addition, the Committee considered
the potential for ongoing temporary improvement in credit performance in the loan portfolios following the period of government support and reduced consumer
spending, and specific areas of risk such as the valuation of buildings with cladding requiring remediation work. The Committee was satisfied that available evidence,
including the use of sensitivity analysis to determine the materiality of changes to assumptions, supported the level of provisioning and it was satisfied that the disclosures
and sensitivities set out in the accounts were sufficiently comprehensive to allow readers to understand the level of judgement associated with the provisions at the year
end.
The Committee considered management’s assessment of the impact of climate change which concluded that it is not yet possible to estimate the credit risk impacts of
climate change to the standards required to justify an impairment provision under IFRS 9. This position will continue to be monitored and management will consider how
best to develop the Society’s climate risk provisioning capabilities, including a process to determine and govern its own climate change scenario assumptions.
Disclosures in respect of credit risk and provisions were considered carefully to ensure that they were transparent and gave insight into Nationwide’s credit risk profile,
taking into account evolving industry best practice and the aims of the PRA to improve consistency. Overall, the Committee was satisfied with the level of provisioning and
related disclosures. The Committee also considered management’s development of capabilities in line with the PRA’s guidance on good practices in impairment
provisioning and was satisfied with progress made.

Provisions for
liabilities and
charges
Information is
included in notes 27
and 29 to the
financial statements

The Committee received updates on a number of matters during the year and considered whether provisions established were appropriate. This included in relation to
conduct issues which may require redress, as well as legal and other regulatory matters. Judgement is required in assessing the likelihood that these matters result in a
liability, to evaluate whether a provision, or alternatively disclosure of a contingent liability, is required. For customer redress provisions, judgement is required in relation
to the number of cases in scope, the associated cost of processing cases for review and the value of redress required. The level of customer redress provisions and the
related judgements reduced over the year.

Capitalisation,
expected useful
lives and
impairment of
intangible assets

Nationwide’s significant investment in technology, together with fast-moving technology development and change, increases the importance of a detailed assessment of
the useful lives of assets, and the implications of new investment, for the existing technology estate. The Committee considered management’s work to review the value
of assets held on the balance sheet and expected useful lives attributed to those assets, and any consequent impairments or changes to useful lives. The Committee
concurred with management’s conclusions that, after impairments and changes to useful lives, carrying values were appropriate and that asset lives were reasonable.

Pension scheme
accounting

Nationwide’s defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities are material to the financial statements, and the valuation of liabilities involves making a number of
assumptions. During the year, the Committee scrutinised assumptions made by management in calculating the surplus relating to the scheme, including reviewing
benchmarking information to ensure that assumptions were appropriate in comparison with market trends. Pension asset valuations were also considered in light of
current market conditions, particularly the increased market volatility experienced during the year. The Committee was satisfied with the assumptions and judgements
made.

104

The Committee reviewed judgements and estimates for a number of matters, discussing with management the criteria for recognition of new provisions or provision
releases, as well as the estimation of liabilities. The Committee concluded that the provisions held, and contingent liability disclosures made, by the Society were
appropriate.

Senior statutory auditor

Audit and non-audit fees

The Committee acknowledges the provisions contained in the
Code in respect of audit tendering and the UK legislation on
mandatory audit rotation and audit tendering. Javier Faiz of EY
became Nationwide’s senior statutory auditor for the financial
year 2019/20 following EY’s appointment as Nationwide’s
external auditor at the Annual General Meeting in July 2019.

During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved EY’s terms
of engagement for the statutory audit and the audit fee. In
addition, the Committee approves any fees for non-audit services
in accordance with the Society’s policy.

Under regulation, Javier Faiz’s term as senior statutory auditor
should not normally exceed a maximum duration of five years.

Auditor independence
EY has confirmed that it has complied with relevant regulatory
and professional requirements and its objectivity is not impaired.
The Committee is satisfied that EY remained independent
throughout the year.
The Board has an established policy setting out the non-audit
services that can be provided by the external auditor. The aim of
the policy, which is reviewed annually, is to safeguard the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors and
comply with the ethical standards of the Financial Reporting
Council (FRC).
The policy specifies non-audit services provided by the external
auditor that are either permitted or prohibited and requires all
non-audit work to be approved by the Committee following a
detailed assessment of the nature of the work, availability of
alternative suppliers and implications for auditor independence.

106

In line with the Society’s non-audit fees policy, all non-audit work is
approved by the Committee where the fee is over £50,000, or by
the Committee Chair and the Chief Financial Officer with
ratification at the next Audit Committee meeting where the fee is
below £50,000. Where aggregate non-audit fees reach 50% of the
statutory audit fee in any given year, all non-audit work must be
approved by the Audit Committee in advance.
During the year, the Committee considered a number of
proposals from management to use the external auditors for nonaudit services, ensuring that management had considered
alternative suppliers and scrutinising analysis of any potential threats to
auditor independence.
The annual value of Nationwide’s non-audit fees is subject to a
regulatory cap. This cap is the amount equal to 70% of the
average of the audit fees paid by Nationwide in the preceding
three financial years. During the year, the Committee reviewed
the cumulative value of non-audit work quarterly to ensure that
Nationwide was compliant with this regulatory requirement.
The fees paid to EY in total for the year ended 4 April 2023 were
£7.1 million (2022: £6.2 million), of which £1.7 million (2022: £1.2
million) were for non-audit services. Non-audit services which fall
within scope of the 70% regulatory cap represented 15% (2022:
14%) of the average statutory audit fee for the previous three
years.

Audit Committee report (continued)

During the financial year 2022/23, approval was granted for the
external auditors to undertake one significant engagement which
related to the verification of Nationwide’s scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2
emissions. The Committee was satisfied that the engagement did
not impact EY’s independence. In addition, EY completed an
engagement, which commenced in 2021/22, relating to a review
of the Society’s regulatory reporting for the PRA. The remainder
of non-audit services provided by EY related mainly to treasury
funding activity.
The value of audit and non-audit fees in respect of the financial
year are disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements.
Having reviewed both the quantum of the non-audit fees and the
nature of the work carried out, the Committee is satisfied that the
non-audit work does not detract from EY’s audit independence.

Effectiveness of the external audit
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the external audit
process annually. The Committee received a report on audit
effectiveness based on a questionnaire to Committee members
and those members of management who interact with the
auditors, regarding the EY audit of the 2021/22 financial
statements. It showed that the external auditor was performing
its duties in an independent and effective manner.

Board Risk
Committee report
Dear fellow member,
I am pleased to present this report for the financial year ended 4 April 2023, my first as Board Risk Committee Chair following my
appointment in July 2022. Prior to my appointment, I spent time as a Committee member and shadowing my predecessor, Tim
Tookey, who provided me with his critical insight and support.
During the year, we have continued to give detailed consideration to the current and emergent risks facing Nationwide, and also
taken the opportunity to simplify how we manage risks, enabling us to continue to monitor, manage and mitigate risk proactively
using the Society’s risk management framework to ensure that members continue to receive the level of service and financial
stability they expect from Nationwide.
In readiness for the implementation of the FCA’s Consumer Duty, which supports the delivery of good customer outcomes, the
Board appointed me as its Consumer Duty Champion. As part of discharging that role I have ensured that the implementation
planning and reporting is being reviewed regularly by the Committee.

“The FCA’s Consumer Duty is
an important piece of
regulation that supports our
values as an organisation to
deliver good customer
outcomes.”

The Committee retains overall responsibility for providing oversight and advice to the Board on all risk matters and has established its
monitoring of economic crime and fraud related risks, which were previously overseen by the Audit Committee. During the year, the
Committee has strengthened oversight and enhanced investment to further improve the Society’s economic crime and fraud controls.
The Committee continued its critical review of the Society’s financial stress testing, modelling and its recovery and resolution
frameworks, and has supported the Board’s examination of climate change and the related risks. An area of particular focus for
the Committee during the year has been to continue its close monitoring of the Society’s credit risks, particularly in the context of
the current macroeconomic environment. We will continue to work closely with the Audit Committee on subjects of common interest.
The Committee is also responsible for IT resilience and related technology risks which were previously overseen by the Board IT
and Resilience Committee. This approach has been taken to ensure consistency of challenge and scrutiny. As a result of this
change, the Committee ensured that sufficient meeting time was given to enable consistent review and monitoring of material
operational and conduct risks. This year, the Committee has focused on mitigating technology risks associated with steps being
taken by the Society to upgrade a number of its major IT systems.
The year ahead will continue to focus on the implementation of the Consumer Duty and how the Committee will then review and
oversee the delivery of good customer outcomes. In addition, the ever changing macro economic environment and its impact on the
Society, its members and other key stakeholders and how that influences the risk landscape, will determine the Committee’s focus.

Board Risk Committee report (continued)

How the Committee works
The Committee comprises at least three independent nonexecutive directors. Alan Keir assumed the role of Committee
Chair in July 2022, following Tim Tookey’s retirement from the
Board. Details of the skills and experience of the Committee
members can be found in their biographies on pages 79 to 82.
Regular attendees include the Society Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer,
Chief Internal Auditor, and representatives of the Society’s
external auditor, EY. The Committee continues to receive
specialist advice from Alison Hewitt on conduct risk. Other
specialist advisors are invited to attend Committee meetings
as and when required.
At each meeting, the Chief Risk Officer shares the Society’s
current and emerging risk profile. The Committee invites
subject matter experts to meetings to present on a variety of
topics. Following each meeting, updates are provided to the

Board, which are supplemented by regular reports from the
Chief Risk Officer.
The Committee oversees the Executive Risk Committee, which
is the management committee responsible for ensuring a coordinated risk management approach across all the Society’s
risks. The oversight and challenge of the day-to-day IT and
resilience risk, control and oversight arrangements of the
Society is now overseen by the Board Risk Committee. This had
previously been delegated to the Board IT and Resilience
Committee, which has since been disbanded. More detail on
the duties and responsibilities of the Committee can be found
within its terms of reference on the Society’s website:
nationwide.co.uk
The Committee held eight scheduled meetings during the
year, and additionally held two joint meetings with the Audit
Committee. The attendance record of Committee members is

set out on page 83.
The Committee’s effectiveness is reviewed annually, along with
its terms of reference and activities over the previous year to
confirm that these activities align with its remit and purpose,
and continue to reflect all applicable governance codes,
guidelines, legislation and best practice. In 2022, the
effectiveness review was undertaken by Secretariat with the
assistance of Lintstock Limited, as part of the three-year Board
and committee effectiveness review process agreed in 2021.
Feedback on the Committee’s performance and effectiveness
was provided to both the Committee and the Board. The
results of the review indicate that Committee members are
satisfied with the performance and effectiveness of the
Committee. The 2022 effectiveness review, including actions
and next steps, is described on pages 97 to 98.

What the Committee did in the year
The principal purpose of the Committee is to provide
oversight on behalf of, and advice to, the Board in relation to
risk-related matters. It fulfils this role by providing advice,
oversight and challenge to enable management to promote,
embed and maintain a strong risk awareness culture
throughout the Society. More detail on the Society’s approach
to the management of risk can be found in the Risk Report on
pages 139 to 142.
In addition to reviewing the Society’s current and emerging
risk exposures, the Committee considered issues which may
present risks to the Society’s strategy as well as issues which
may crystallise into future risk events.
The Board considers the appropriateness of the Society’s
strategic plan in the context of its risk appetite. During the year, the
Committee endorsed the Society’s Board Risk Appetite to the
Board and monitored performance against it, including
undertaking appropriate reviews of material risks.

The Committee provides, in conjunction with the Audit
Committee, input to the Remuneration Committee to assist in
its assessment of possible impacts on variable remuneration.
An outline of the key topics considered by the Committee
during the year is broken down by risk category and set
out below.
Prudential risk (includes credit, model, liquidity and
funding, market, capital and pension risks)
The Society lends in a responsible, affordable and
sustainable way to ensure we safeguard members’
interests and maintain financial strength through the
credit cycle. The Committee reviewed and challenged the
plans to ensure that the Society maintains sufficient
capital and liquidity resources to support current
business activity and to remain resilient to significant
stress.
During the year, the Committee reviewed a number of

108

aspects of prudential risk as required by the Bank of England and
the PRA. This included scrutiny of the Society’s resolution
framework, capital and liquidity adequacy (as reported in the
ICAAP and ILAAP respectively), the Pillar 3 risk disclosures, the
recovery plan and the 2023 Reverse Stress Test results.
The Committee monitored the impact of the current
macroeconomic and political environment including the
November 2022 Budget, cost of living challenges, the ongoing
conflict in Ukraine, rising inflation and interest rates.
The Committee approved updates to the Society’s risk strategy on
the management of capital risk and enhancements to controls
around management capability.
Operational and conduct risk
The Society seeks to minimise customer disruption, financial loss
and reputational damage by providing sustainable services and
resilient systems.

Nomination and
Governance
Committee Report
Dear fellow member,
I am pleased to report on the work of the Nomination and Governance Committee during the financial year ended 4 April 2023.
The Committee continues to play a critical role in promoting the long-term sustainable success of the Society for the benefit of its
members and other stakeholders by ensuring that the Society is led by a Board and executive management that possess the
appropriate combination of skills and experience.
Ensuring that the Board is well balanced in terms of its structure, skills, knowledge, experience and diversity, forms a key part in
enabling the Society to achieve its objectives and successfully pursue its long-term strategy. The Committee maintains and
implements an effective succession plan to ensure that the Board continues to serve the best interests of the Society’s members, both
now and in the future, recognising that our members’ needs and priorities are ever-changing. Alan Keir was appointed as a member
of the Committee in July 2022, whilst Mai Fyfield stepped down as a Committee member following Tracey Graham’s appointment as a
member in January 2023. My introduction to the Governance Report on page 78 outlines the changes to Board and its committee
composition made during the year, all of which have been overseen by this Committee.
This is the first year in which the Society is required to disclose certain diversity data relating to both its Board and executive
management and report on its performance against three diversity targets set by the FCA in its Annual Report and Accounts. This
information can be found on page 96. The Society’s agenda on inclusion and diversity remains an area of particular focus for the
Committee, with the addition of new inclusion and wellbeing measures. Management presented regular updates on the progress
made against the Society’s agreed inclusion, diversity and wellbeing measures to the Committee throughout the year. An area of
increasing focus for the Committee is the work being undertaken across the Society in respect of social mobility, which aims to ensure
that all of our people have the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or upbringing. During the year,
each of the Society’s directors participated in a Society-wide socio-economic background data-gathering exercise, in support of this
workstream.
As part of its remit, the Committee provides oversight of the Society’s governance framework on behalf of the Board to ensure that it
remains effective and aligned with best practice. The Committee is satisfied that the current governance framework has continued to
operate effectively and efficiently throughout the year.

Nomination and Governance Committee report

“This is the first year in which the
Society is required to disclose its
performance against three diversity
targets set by the FCA relating to the
composition of its Board and
executive management. I am pleased
to report that all three targets have
been met, two of which have been
exceeded.”
Looking forward to 2023/24
The Committee will continue to focus on Board and senior
management composition and skills, succession planning, driving
inclusion and diversity across the Society and overseeing Board
and Committee performance plans and training, including
leadership programmes for high-potential individuals. It will also
oversee management’s work in promoting and progressing
inclusion and diversity within the leadership pipeline.

How the Committee works
The Committee is chaired by the Society Chairman and the
members are four independent non-executive directors.
Alan Keir was appointed as a member of the Committee in
July 2022, whilst Mai Fyfield stepped down as a Committee
member following Tracey Graham’s appointment as a
member in January 2023. Details of the skills and
experience of the Committee members can be found in
their biographies on pages 79 to 82.
In addition to the members, regular attendees of the
Committee include: the CEO, Director of People & Culture,
General Counsel, Society Secretary and Baroness Usha
Prashar, adviser to the Board.

The Committee provides oversight and advice to the
Board on the matters listed in its terms of reference
(available at nationwide.co.uk) and reports to the Board
on those matters after each meeting.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and otherwise
as required. During the year, the Committee held five
scheduled meetings. The attendance record of
Committee members is set out on page 83.
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed annually,
along with the Committee’s terms of reference and its
activities over the previous year.

The purpose of this review is to confirm that the terms of
reference align with the Committee’s remit and purpose,
and continue to reflect all applicable governance codes,
guidelines, legislation and best practice. In 2022, the
effectiveness review was undertaken by the Society’s
Secretariat with the assistance of Lintstock Limited, as
part of the three-year Board and committee effectiveness
review process agreed in 2021. Feedback on the
performance and effectiveness of the Committee was
provided to both the Committee and the Board. The
results of the review indicate that Committee members
are satisfied with the performance and effectiveness of
the Committee. The 2022 effectiveness review, including
Board actions and next steps that the Committee is
monitoring, is described on pages 97 to 98.

What the Committee did in the year
Executive resourcing, leadership, talent, and
succession
The Committee received updates on the flow of internal and
external appointments, promotions and planned appointments
for senior leadership and other key roles. There is a continued
focus on recruitment processes to encourage more diverse
appointments to senior roles.
In overseeing the Society’s approach to resourcing the needs
of the business, and developing our colleagues, the Committee
has continued to focus on strengthening the Society’s
leadership to ensure it has the talent needed for the future.
The Committee received biannual updates on the Society’s
executive succession management, including reviews of
emergency succession plans and talent management
development plans for longer-term succession. This provided
the Committee with a view of the talent pipeline of potential
leaders as well their key strengths and development areas. It
was noted that longer-term succession planning requires early
focus to address capability requirements and diverse
representation. In addition, the Committee considered
succession and capability planning within the Risk Community
during the year.

Inclusion, diversity & wellbeing
The Committee oversees the development and
implementation of the Society’s inclusion, diversity and
wellbeing (ID&W) strategy and objectives. In June 2022,
the Society’s agreed diversity measures were updated to
include inclusion and wellbeing measures for the 2022/23
financial year. The Society’s ambition is to build an
inclusive culture where everyone can thrive and for the
diversity of our Society to reflect the diversity of the
communities we serve.
Throughout the year, the Committee received updates
on the significant work undertaken to embed ID&W
throughout the organisation and make progress in
achieving the Society’s ID&W ambitions. This included:
• Undertaking an independent review of progress
in ID&W matters and a supporting benchmarking
exercise to identify areas of key focus;
• Introducing new inclusion and wellbeing
measures which aim to reduce the gap in
experience between the majority and underrepresented groups within the Society;
• Upskilling our people managers and leaders to
develop high-performing and diverse teams who
have the ability to challenge ‘group think’ in order
to achieve Nationwide’s strategic objectives; and
• Ensuring leadership accountability for the delivery
of the ID&W agenda.
Good progress has been made in the last year;
however, the Society’s diversity outcomes are not yet
where we want them to be and ID&W will remain a
critical focus for the Committee. More information on
the Society’s ID&W strategy, measures and progress
made can be found on pages 50 to 51.
The Board is committed to ensuring that it has a
membership which is diverse and reflects the
communities that it represents. It aims to achieve this
by ensuring there is diversity of ethnicity, age, gender,
disability and sexual orientation, as well as socioeconomic, educational and professional backgrounds,
within the Board’s membership.
112

Other information

Existing efforts will be built on and considered in the
development of a diverse pipeline for Board succession.
Selecting the best candidate is paramount and all
appointments are based on merit and objective criteria with
due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board. This
benefits the effectiveness of the Board by creating diversity of
thought and breadth of perspective among our directors.
This is the first year in which the Society is required to
disclose certain diversity data relating to both its Board and
executive management within the Annual Report and
Accounts, including performance against three diversity
targets that have been set by the FCA. This information, as
well as detail relating to the approach taken in the collation
of this diversity data, can be found on page 96.
The Board’s gender and ethnicity targets in respect of
individuals at senior levels within the Society have been set to
go beyond those prescribed by the FCA through alignment
with the Society’s gender (50%) and ethnicity (12%) targets.
Whilst recognising that short-term challenges may exist
owing to the size of the Board during periods of change,
these targets seek to strengthen the Board’s commitment to
ensuring diversity at senior levels within the Society.
As part of this commitment, the Committee continues to
review the development of the pipeline of both ethnically
diverse and female executive management within the Society
and, as a signatory to the Women in Finance Charter, the
Society is committed to supporting the progression of
women into senior roles. In addition, the Society is a
signatory of the Race at Work Charter, which involves a
Board-level commitment to zero tolerance of harassment
and bullying, particularly racial.
To increase our focus on disability inclusion, the Society is a
member of the Valuable 500, a global collective of 500 chief
executive officers and their companies which uses the power
of business to ensure that disability is discussed at Board
level and make business more inclusive of those living with a
disability. Signatories are required to put disability inclusion
on their leadership agenda and to publish a firm pledge for
action.

Nomination and Governance Committee report
(continued)

To support the work being undertaken across the Society in
respect of social mobility, the Society has become a partner
of the Progress Together Partnership, which aims to
promote socio-economic diversity at senior levels by enabling
all people working within the UK financial services sector to
achieve their full potential, regardless of their background or
upbringing. During the year, each of the Society’s directors
participated in a Society-wide socio-economic background
data-gathering exercise, in support of this workstream.
The Board’s Diversity Statement is set out in the Board
Composition and Succession Policy which can be found
on the Society’s website: nationwide.co.uk
Board composition and effectiveness
As part of its remit, the Committee is required to assist
the Society Chairman in subjecting the composition of
the Board and its committees to regular review. The
purpose of these reviews is to identify the current and
likely future needs of the Board and to lead the
appointments process for nominations to the Board.
This includes ensuring that the Society has the right
mix of knowledge, skills and behaviours on the Board
for it to be effective in delivering its responsibilities to
provide oversight and governance of the Society and to
safeguard the interests of its members.
In determining the Board’s needs, the Committee
considers a range of factors including the diversity of
the Board in its widest sense, the Society’s strategy,
current and future challenges and opportunities facing
the Society and the need to balance continuity and
knowledge of the Society with progressive changes to
the membership of the Board and its committees. The
recruitment process for directors is designed to ensure
that the Board possesses a diverse range of skills and
appropriate objectivity.
It also involves detailed referencing and other checks to
establish the candidate’s credentials, including
suitability, fitness and propriety. Regulatory approval is
required for certain Board roles.

Selection process for new non-executive directors
during 2022/23
Following a review of the composition of the Board and
the planned retirement of Mai Fyfield at the 2023 AGM,
the Committee identified a potential gap on the Board
and the need for an independent non-executive director
with a deep understanding and practical experience of
remuneration practices. As such, the Committee
oversaw and recommended to the Board the
appointment of Tracey Graham as independent nonexecutive director and Chair of the Remuneration
Committee.
The Committee engaged Korn Ferry, an independent
executive search firm, to assist with the search. Korn
Ferry was independent other than in the context of
having provided search services for previous
appointment processes. The Committee, supported by
Korn Ferry, prepared a candidate specification based on
objective criteria, setting out the knowledge, skills,
experience and attributes required. From the candidate
specification, a longlist of potential candidates was
drawn up from which a shortlist was compiled.
Following interview with three shortlisted candidates,
conducted by the Society Chairman and Society
Secretary, two preferred candidates emerged for the
role. A panel of three independent non-executive
directors was convened, which included the Senior
Independent Director, to conduct second-round
interviews. Following due and careful consideration, and

taking into account the current needs of the Board, Tracey
Graham, on a unanimous decision, succeeded as the sole
preferred candidate for the role.

approved the Nationwide Governance Manual and
reviewed the corporate governance disclosures in the
2022 and 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee agreed that Tracey’s appointment fulfils
the need to further strengthen the Board with a nonexecutive director with skills and experience and
succeeded Mai Fyfield as Remuneration Committee Chair
in January 2023.

Individual accountability regimes

Board performance review
The Code requires the Chairman to lead an annual Board
review. In 2022 the review was conducted by the Society’s
Secretariat with the assistance of Lintstock Limited, as
part of the three-year Board and committee effectiveness
review process, agreed in 2021. The Committee oversaw
the work undertaken by Secretariat and Lintstock Limited,
which looked at the overall effectiveness of the Board and
its committees and provided an objective assessment of
the strengths, capabilities, effectiveness and dynamics of
the Board. More information on the effectiveness review
can be found on pages 97 to 98.
Corporate governance

The Senior Manager and Certification Regime (SM&CR)
was introduced by the Society’s regulators to encourage
senior managers working within the financial services
industry to take greater responsibility for their actions.
SM&CR aims to stop recurrence of poor behaviours which
could result in poor member outcomes. In addition, it
enables regulators to take action against individuals in
cases where significant wrongdoing has been identified.
The Committee continues to focus on regulatory
requirements to ascertain suitability, fitness and propriety
of relevant individuals and to ensure that SM&CR
responsibilities are allocated appropriately through the
Society’s well-established mapping process.
Overall, the Society’s processes and controls in relation to
both the accountability regimes and the assessment of the
Financial Conduct Authority Conduct Rules breaches
continue to operate effectively.

As part of its remit, the Committee is responsible for the
oversight of the Society’s governance arrangements on
behalf of the Board. The Committee reviewed and

Report of the directors on remuneration

Report of the directors on
remuneration
For the year ended 4 April 2023

Dear fellow member,
I am pleased to share the Remuneration Committee’s report, and my first as Chair of the Committee. I would like to place on record my
sincere thanks to my predecessor, Mai Fyfield, for her service to the Committee and for her support in ensuring a smooth handover. I would
also like to thank my fellow Committee members for their support and contribution to the work of the Committee throughout the year. This
report includes details of directors’ pay for the year ended 4 April 2023 and how the Society intends to implement the directors’
remuneration policy for 2023/24.
Over the last year, since the appointment of Debbie Crosbie as our first female Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Nationwide has delivered
strong financial performance and continued support for our customers, demonstrating resilience in a challenging environment. We
emerged from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to face unprecedented cost of living pressures affecting both customers and colleagues
alike. Since joining the Board, I have been impressed by our colleagues’ professionalism and commitment to deliver for customers, and I am
pleased the Society has been able to support colleagues during this period.
The Committee has ensured pay outcomes for 2022/23 are commensurate with the strength of the Society’s performance and the
contribution of our colleagues during the year, and has aligned our remuneration framework with our new strategy and purpose. The
Committee undertook a detailed review of the performance measures that will apply to our variable pay arrangements in 2023/24, and
refreshed our reward proposition for the wider workforce to ensure that it will support the delivery of our new strategy and enable the
Society to differentiate reward outcomes based on colleague performance and behaviours.
Our directors’ remuneration policy received strong support at the 2022 AGM (with 93.5% of votes ‘FOR’), and I would like to thank
members for their ongoing support. For 2022/23, I can confirm that we operated in line with the approved remuneration policy, a summary
of which is set out in this report.
Supporting our wider workforce
Our colleagues are integral to the Society as we strive to deliver the best customer outcomes and serve members’ interests, and we find
ourselves competing in an increasingly competitive labour market with a shortage of skilled talent. The Committee is conscious of the impact
inflationary pressures have had in creating financial challenges for many of our customers and colleagues, and we were therefore supportive
of the decisions and actions the Society’s leaders took during this difficult period. This included making a £1,200 cost of living payment during
the year to our lower earning employees and the base pay package agreed with the Nationwide Group Staff Union (NGSU) for 2023/24. Under
this package, over 99% of our colleagues, excluding those in most senior roles, received a 6.5% salary increase effective three months earlier
than normal, and also received a £500 one-off payment. The Society also introduced a skills and competency pay framework for some frontline roles, which rewards colleagues for deepening and broadening their skills to better support customers. Overall, the total average value
delivered by the package for 2023/24 was around 11% of salary.

The Committee approved the first awards to be granted under
the LTPP plan to be made to the CEO and CFO. The LTPP will
reward sustainable long-term performance linked to strategic
objectives and alignment with member interests over a threeyear period to April 2026. Given that these are the first awards
to be made under the plan, the Committee carefully considered
the appropriate measures, including reviewing market practice
and obtaining external independent input. To ensure awards
will incentivise and reward management for the delivery of
sustainable long-term performance, aligned with our new
strategy and purpose, the Committee agreed that the LTPP
scorecard would be weighted such that 40% is based on
financial goals, 20% on risk and compliance, 20% on
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals, with the
remaining 20% based on delivering against transformation
objectives linked to the Society’s strategic drivers. Further
details on the measures are set out on page 124.
Taking account of Society and individual performance during
2022/23, the Committee agreed to grant the executive
directors LTPP awards of 100% of base salary, which remain
subject to a three-year performance period.
Looking ahead to 2023/24
In the context of the base pay package agreed for the wider
workforce, the Committee approved base salary increases of
6% for the executive directors, effective from 1 April 2023,
lower than the average award received by the wider workforce.
As noted above, 2023/24 APP awards for all eligible
employees, including executive directors, will be based on the
same Society gateways and performance measures, to ensure
everyone works together to deliver our new strategy and
purpose. Details of these measures are set out on page 118.
The maximum APP award for the executive directors continues
to be set at 100% of salary.
An assessment of the Society’s performance, and the individual
performance of the executive directors, will be made by the
Committee at the end of the year to determine whether further
awards will be made under the LTPP plan in respect of
2023/24, with the maximum award being 100% of salary.

the final policy position and keep the potential impact for
Nationwide under review.

How the Committee works
The members of the Committee are all non-executive directors
of the Society. The composition of the Committee, and the
number of meetings attended in the year are set out on page
83. The Committee held six scheduled meetings and two adhoc meetings during the year.
Regular attendees of the Committee include the Society
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief People Officer and the
Director of Performance & Reward. On an annual basis the
Committee also invites the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Internal
Auditor to attend. In no case is any person present when their
own remuneration is discussed.
Deloitte LLP, independent external consultants, also attend
meetings. The Committee retained Deloitte during 2022/23
following a competitive tender process in 2019. It reviews
annually all other services provided by Deloitte to ensure they
continue to be independent and objective. Deloitte is a
founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and
voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to

executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte's
advisory team has no connection with any individual director of
Nationwide. Their fees for advice provided to the Committee
during 2022/23 were £190,050 (excluding VAT), typically
charged on a time-and-materials basis. Deloitte also provided
tax, risk, internal audit and consulting services to the Society
during 2022/23.
The Chair of the Committee attended meetings with the PRA
and FCA.
The Committee is supported by the Board Risk and Audit
committees on risk-related matters, including performance
pay plan design, the assessment of specific performance
measures, and wider issues relating to risk and controls.
Further details can be found in the reports of those
committees on pages 100 to 109.

nationwide.co.uk) and reports to the Board on those matters
after each meeting.
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed annually, along
with the Committee’s terms of reference and its activities over
the previous year, to confirm that these activities align with its
remit and purpose, and continue to reflect all applicable
governance codes, guidelines, legislation and best practice. In
2022, the effectiveness review was undertaken by Secretariat
with the assistance of Lintstock Limited, as part of the threeyear Board and committee effectiveness review process, which
was agreed in 2021. Feedback on the Committee’s
performance and effectiveness was provided to both the
Committee and the Board. The results of the review indicate
that the Committee’s members are satisfied with the
performance and effectiveness of the Committee. The 2022
effectiveness review, including actions and next steps is
described on pages 97 to 98.

The Committee provides oversight and advice to the Board on

What the Committee did in the year
Pay strategy and approach

Performance award outcomes

The Committee reviewed and approved the approach to
variable pay for 2023/24, to ensure it supports the new
strategy and purpose and enables the Society to recognise
exceptional colleague performance and customer service. The
Committee also reviewed the approach to the use of the
Society’s CCDS for remuneration purposes and approved the
approach to performance measures for the first LTPP awards
to be made to the executive directors, details of which are set
out on page 124.

The Committee approved the outcome of the annual incentive
arrangement for 2021/22.
The Committee reviewed its approach to risk adjustment,
strengthening the robust process for making decisions to
reduce variable pay where individuals are accountable for risk
events. The Committee made decisions on risk adjustment in
April 2023, including for variable payments due in June 2023.
Oversight of remuneration across the Society

The Committee considered wider colleague analysis, including
pay decisions by diversity characteristic and the outputs of
internal survey data on pay and benefits. In making executive
pay decisions, the Committee took account of remuneration
practices across the Society. In addition to information
received on Nationwide’s wider workforce pay practices
throughout the year, the Board received an annual update
from the general secretary of the NGSU in November 2022 and
from the Employee Voice non-executive director, Tamara
Rajah, in March 2023. More information on Board engagement
with colleagues can be found on pages 31 to 32.

The Committee received updates on how remuneration is a
part of creating a healthy culture in the workplace and
considered how remuneration policies are aligned with the
Society’s purpose, strategy and values.

Regulatory reporting

Procedural matters

The Committee reviewed and approved the Report of the
Directors on Remuneration for 2021/22. It also reviewed and
approved all remuneration submissions made to the PRA and
FCA over the course of the year.

The Committee agreed the base pay and variable pay
arrangements for all employees in scope of the PRA and FCA
Remuneration Codes.
The Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing
with the Board the remuneration strategy, how that strategy is
reflected in the remuneration policy, and approved pay reviews
for the Society Chairman, executive directors, and the
Executive Committee (ExCo) for 2023/24, taking into
consideration pay review decisions for the wider workforce.

Alignment between wider workforce and executive directors’ remuneration
Our reward framework is designed to attract, motivate and retain colleagues who are inspired to do their best for our customers every day, and to reward all colleagues fairly across the Society. The
framework for executive directors is aligned with the wider workforce except for the LTPP plan. This difference ensures our executive directors have a significant proportion of their remuneration
linked to the Society’s longer-term priorities and provides a clear link with members’ interests and the achievement of our financial and strategic aims, including our sustainability commitments.

Annual Performance Pay plan

Long-Term Performance Pay plan

Salaries are set to reflect the work colleagues do
and the contribution they make, informed by
external market benchmarking and the salary of
colleagues doing similar roles. We are a principal
partner of the Living Wage Foundation.

We offer a range of contractual benefits specific to
role and all colleagues have access to My Reward,
our flexible benefits and discounts scheme, to meet
personal needs at varying stages of life.

All of our colleagues who meet individual conduct
requirements are eligible to participate in the APP
plan, with consistent performance measures for all
participants, ensuring clear alignment and focus
across the Society in delivering against our strategic
drivers and for our customers. Awards are generally
paid in cash. However, for more senior colleagues,
awards are paid in a mixture of cash and CCDS,
subject to relevant deferral criteria.

Our most senior population, including executive
directors, are invited to participate in the LTPP
plan. It supports the delivery of sustainable
member value and the performance measures are
aligned to the Society’s longer-term priorities and
the achievement of our financial and strategic
aims, including our sustainability commitments.

If our employees contribute 4% of base salary to
their pension, we will contribute 13% and match
any additional contributions up to a maximum
employer contribution of 16%. Executive directors’
contributions are aligned to the wider workforce.

118

Subject to eligibility, benefits include 25 to 30 days
holiday, health care, death in service cover, an
electric vehicle scheme, parental and other leave,
and retirement planning.

LTPP awards are deferred over the long-term and
will only be paid subject to sustained satisfactory
Society and individual performance.

Annual report on remuneration for 2022/23
This section provides information on how the directors’ remuneration policy, as approved by members at the 2022 AGM, was implemented during 2022/23. A summary of the policy can be found
on pages 132 to 134.

Base salary and pension
The effective base salary for C S Rhodes in the year was £690,428. D Crosbie was appointed on a salary of £1,072,250 from her commencement as CEO in June 2022. The pension allowances of our
executive directors are 16% of salary, which is the maximum benefit available to the wider employee population.

Annual Performance Pay (APP) for 2022/23
APP for 2022/23 had two elements: an all-employee element and an element for our most senior leaders, including executive directors. Both elements of APP were aligned with the attainment of
challenging strategic and financial measures drawn from the Society’s Plan for 2022/23, as set out below. These measures ensured focus on delivering benefits to our members, and for 2022/23 the
element in which senior leaders participated included an additional controls measure. The senior element also incorporates an amount based on individual performance and behaviours.

Objectives reflecting each individual’s contribution
towards the delivery of the Society’s Plan as well

The maximum potential APP award level for 2022/23 was 100% of base salary for both the CEO and CFO, with 26.4% of the overall award based on individual performance. An illustration of the
pay-out schedule of the executive directors' APP awards can be found on page 125. The Society has the ability to claw back APP awards for up to ten years after they were awarded in certain
circumstances.

Outcomes for APP 2022/23
Three ‘gateways’ must be passed before any payment is made under the plan. The three gateways are based on measures of profit before tax, leverage ratio and conduct risk. These gateways were
passed in 2022/23. In determining executive directors’ APP outcomes for 2022/23, the Committee assessed the Society’s performance against the four measures set out below. The Committee
must also be satisfied that there are no significant conduct, risk, reputational, financial, operational or other reasons why awards should not be made, taking into account input from the Board Risk
and Audit committees. D Crosbie’s APP award reflects performance since her appointment in June 2022. Details on awards made to the former CEO, J D Garner are set out on page 126.

Remuneration Committee discretionary overlay that applied for the all-employee element and risk assessment
The Committee carefully considered the outcomes for the executive directors to ensure they were a fair reflection of performance. As set out in the
Committee Chair’s letter, reflecting the strong financial performance of the Society delivered in the year, an additional amount was approved under
the all-employee element of the plan for the wider workforce. This value was also delivered to the executive directors as participants in the allemployee plan. The Committee also took into account a broad range of factors and, where deemed appropriate, applied a downwards adjustment
to take into account risk factors arising during the year. The aggregate impact of the Committee’s decisions for each individual is shown.

Notes:
i. As referenced in the Committee Chair’s letter (see pages 114 to 116), whilst the actual committed members and FRS satisfaction outcomes for 2022/23 of 3.68m and 1st +3.8%pts respectively were lower than the original plan
targets for the year, for the purposes of determining APP outcomes for all eligible employees, including executive directors, the Remuneration Committee agreed target outcomes for these elements. This adjusted outcome
took into account strategic decisions taken during 2022/23 and the strength of the Society’s overall performance for the year.
ii. © Ipsos 2023, Financial Research Survey (FRS), for the 12 months ending 31 March 2023. Results based on a sample of around 47,000 adults (aged 16+). The survey contacts around 51,000 adults (aged 16+) a year in total
across Great Britain. Interviews were over the phone and online, taking into account (and weighted to) the overall profile of the adult population. The results reflect the percentage of extremely satisfied and very satisfied
customers minus the percentage of customers who were extremely or very or fairly dissatisfied across those customers with a main current account, mortgage or savings. Those in our peer group are providers with more than
3.3% of the main current account market as of April 2022 – Barclays, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, NatWest, Santander and TSB.
iii. The Committee agreed that the actual total costs outcome for 2022/23 of £2,323m should be adjusted for the purposes of determining APP outcomes. The Committee considered the impact of the inflationary environment and
decisions approved by the Board during the year that impacted the Society’s costs position, including actions to support colleagues such as cost of living payments, a higher than planned annual pay review award and one-off
£500 payment in April 2023. The outcome for this element for the wider workforce, including executive directors, was therefore agreed at target.
iv. For the Controls measure, the Audit Committee considered progress against our Process and Controls Improvement Programme (PCIP), taking into account achievement against specific milestones as well as assurance activity.
The Chairs of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee applied a downwards adjustment to the recommended outcome of 105% for this measure, representing the progress made to date. The Remuneration
Committee subsequently approved the adjusted outcome of 100% for use in APP outcomes.

Long-Term Performance Pay (LTPP) awards in respect of 2022/23
The first LTPP awards will be granted in June 2023.
LTPP awards are discretionary and are granted subject to a pre-grant performance assessment over the year prior to grant based on:
•
•

Individual conduct and performance – must be satisfactory including an assessment of individual behaviours and conduct during the year;
Leverage ratio and statutory profit before tax – both gateways must be assessed and passed in respect of the period prior to grant.

After taking into account performance over 2022/23, the Committee agreed to grant D Crosbie and C S Rhodes LTPP awards of 100% of base salary. This included an assessment of both Society and
individual performance. The Committee is satisfied that the granting of awards is sustainable according to the financial position of the Society and justified on the basis of individual performance,
conduct and behaviours. J D Garner was not eligible to receive an award under the LTPP plan as he departed during the year.
Over the course of 2022/23, the Committee has been focused on the selection and development of appropriate forward-looking performance measures for the LTPP awards. The Committee is
satisfied that the chosen performance measures are aligned to the Society’s longer-term priorities and provide a clear link with members’ interests and the achievement of our financial and strategic
aims, including our sustainability commitments. At the end of the three-year performance period the Committee will also satisfy itself that there are no significant conduct, risk, reputational,
financial, operational or other reasons why the awards should not be released, taking into account input from the Board Risk and Audit committees.
The 2022/23 LTPP awards will be subject to a three-year performance period commencing 5 April 2023. During this period, performance will be assessed based on a scorecard comprising the
elements below. Targets are deemed by the Committee to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed, along with performance achieved, in the Annual Report and Accounts 2026.

How awards will be released to executive directors
The illustration below shows how APP and LTPP awards will typically be released to executive directors over the long term. Under the directors’ remuneration policy, across both elements a
minimum of 60% will be deferred for between three and seven years. To the extent the minimum level of deferral is not met via the LTPP award, a proportion of the APP award will be deferred.
For awards in respect of 2022/23, the LTPP will be used to satisfy the minimum deferral requirements for D Crosbie. For C S Rhodes a small proportion of his APP award will also be deferred for
between three and seven years.
In line with the directors’ remuneration policy, subject to the achievement of the forward-looking performance measures, 60% of any award will be delivered in or linked to the market or fair value
of the Society’s CCDS, with the balance paid in cash. The CCDS element will be subject to a twelve-month retention period. As set out in the Chair’s letter (see pages 114 to 116), following a review of
the Society’s approach to the use of CCDS for remuneration purposes, two modifications are being made to ensure that awards provide appropriate alignment to the credit quality of Nationwide and
to align with market practice, namely adjusting the CCDS price used to remove the impact of long-term interest rates and adjusting the number of notional CCDS units awarded to reflect the
absence of CCDS distributions over the deferral period.

Notes:
i. Travel and other taxable benefits are included as fixed remuneration for the calculation of the variable pay ratio in meeting our regulatory requirements. A full description of the taxable benefits is set out below.
ii. Amounts shown consist of the awards under the APP plan; LTPP awards are subject to the achievement of performance conditions over the next three years and, to the extent the performance measures are met,
details will be included in the relevant directors’ remuneration report.
iii. D Crosbie succeeded J D Garner as CEO on 2 June 2022. As announced in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022, the Committee agreed to compensate D Crosbie for the forfeiture of variable pay awards from her
previous employment at TSB. In line with regulatory requirements, these replacement awards are not more generous in terms or amounts than she would otherwise have received.
iv. J D Garner stepped down as CEO and from the Board on 1 June 2022; details of his remuneration reflect the period of time he served on the Board. Further details can be found on page 130.

In the single figure table above, ‘taxable benefits’ includes certain essential travel costs for directors, in connection with the performance of their duties, including any tax due under HMRC
regulations. Other benefits include medical insurance, car allowance and security.

Notes:
i. Taxable benefits for non-executive directors relate to expenses incurred for travel in connection with their duties and attendance at Board and committee meetings. Where these expenses are deemed taxable, the
Society settles the tax on behalf of the non-executive directors and this is included in the amounts shown. Where a non-executive director is not UK domiciled their reimbursed cost of travel into and out of the UK is
not a taxable benefit.

Notes:
i. The increase in annual performance pay between 2020/21 and 2021/22 is reflective of the return to previous levels of opportunity following a reduction to one third of opportunity in 2020/21.
ii. The reduction in benefits between 2019/20 and 2020/21 reflects reduced travel costs in the year as a result of a significant reduction in travel due to the pandemic.
iii. D Crosbie joined the Board on 2 June 2022.
iv. The percentage increase in salary for J D Garner from 2020/21 to 2021/22 reflects the voluntary temporary reduction in base salary for 2020/21 in the context of the pandemic.
v. The annual performance pay for J D Garner and C S Rhodes for 2019/20 was £nil and therefore no percentage change is shown.
vi. The non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the annual performance pay plan.

Payroll costs represent 39.52% (2022: 36.79%) of total

year was £1,664 million, of which £186 million was paid as
distributions and the remaining £1,478 million is held as
retained earnings.

Payments for loss of office / Payments to past
directors
J D Garner stepped down from the Board as CEO on 1 June
2022. As set out in the 2022 Annual Report on Remuneration,
he remained an employee of the Society until 12 December
2022, the end of his twelve-month notice period. For this
period, he received total payments of £588,120, which
included salary (£491,934), benefits (£17,477) and pension
(£78,709).
In addition, as set out in last year’s report, J D Garner was
eligible to receive a part-year APP award in respect of services
as CEO during 2022/23. His APP award was based on the
same Society performance measures as the other executive
directors, as set out on page 120, as well as individual
performance.
For the proportion of the award based on the Society’s
performance (70% of the award), recognising the length of J D
Garner’s tenure during the year, and therefore contribution to
the Society’s performance over this period, the Committee
approved an outcome of 54.1% of salary (paid to 1 June 2022)
for the Society element. The Committee did not approve the
application of discretion in relation to the total costs measure
for J D Garner.
130

Financial statements

Other information

For the proportion of the award based on individual
performance (30% of the award), the Committee considered
J D Garner’s performance against individual objectives for the
portion of the year served, including his contribution to
ensuring an orderly handover. Taking this into account, the
Committee approved an outcome of 14% of salary (paid to 1
June 2022) for the individual performance element.
In determining J D Garner’s APP outcome for the year, the
Committee also applied a downwards risk adjustment of 5% to
the value of the combined Society and individual elements of
the award to take into account a range of risk factors including
pace of execution.
Taking all of the above elements together, the Committee
approved an overall APP award of 64.7% of salary (paid to 1
June 2022) for J D Garner.
J D Garner was not eligible to receive an award under the LTPP
for 2022/23 as he departed during the year.

Pay gap reporting
The Society is fully committed to promoting a diverse and
inclusive workplace. The gender pay gap measures the
difference in earnings between women and men across all
roles. Our latest report was published in March 2023 and can
be found at nationwide.co.uk, together with an update of
progress on our inclusion and diversity ambition, and Women
in Finance Charter commitments. We have also again
voluntarily published our ethnicity pay gap, comparing the pay
of all employees who have identified as black, Asian and
minority ethnicity (ethnically diverse), with the pay for white
(non-ethnically diverse) employees across Nationwide.
As of 5 April 2022, our mean gender pay gap was 30%
(remaining the same as the previous year) and our mean
ethnicity pay gap was 7.4% (decreasing from 11% in the
previous year, primarily due to an increase in the number of
ethnically diverse employees recruited into technology).

Report of the directors on remuneration
(continued)

While we have imbalances in the distribution of women and
ethnically diverse colleagues, we will have pay gaps. We’re
proud that colleagues choose to stay with the Society for a long
time, so we know that making changes to our workforce mix
and pay gaps will take time. This is why it’s imperative to
continue focusing on our diversity and inclusion measures and
priorities to create the changes we want to see in the long
term. Our LTPP scorecard for 2022/23 awards is directly linked
to these measures. Some of the other actions we have taken
include: introducing an interactive diversity and inclusion
dashboard to enable leaders to understand progress and
opportunities and also to create targeted interventions to
identify and develop diverse talent, such as proactive
succession planning, external talent mapping and talent
acceleration programme.
Pay gaps are not the same as equal pay. We carry out regular
equal pay audits, checking the pay of people with different
characteristics (such as gender and ethnicity) doing the same
or similar roles. Our audits continue to show that our pay
policies are operating fairly.

Notes:
i. The calculation is based on Option A as set out in the regulations which is considered to be the most statistically accurate methodology.
ii. Employee data includes full time equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees as at 1 March 2023. For each employee, remuneration was calculated based on all components of pay including base pay,
performance pay for 2022/23, core benefits including medical insurance and car allowance, and pension payments.
iii. For 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21, whilst most employees participated in a defined contribution scheme with a fixed maximum employer contribution, there were other pension arrangements in place for some
employees, including a defined benefit pension scheme which has been closed to new participants since 2007. Although it would have been possible to recognise a higher value under the defined benefit scheme, in
order to ensure accurate year on year comparative data, a fixed value equal to the maximum employer contribution available to the defined contribution scheme members was included for all defined benefit scheme
members. From 2021/22 there is only one defined contribution scheme available; therefore, the actual employer contribution value has been used for all employees.
iv. The Committee has considered the pay data for the three individuals identified for 2022/23 and confirms that the ratios reasonably represent the Society’s approach to pay and reward for employees taken as a whole.

Operation
Following detailed consideration by the Committee over the course of the year, the APP plan
(previously the DAPA) has been simplified such that there is only one element of the award from
2023/24 onwards (i.e., the all-employee element and the senior leader element have been
consolidated into a single award).
To ensure continued alignment across the Society, the award for all eligible colleagues will
continue to be based on the same Society performance measures as our senior leaders. These
measures will make up 70% of the award for executive directors.
Alongside awards under the LTPP plan, the payment and deferral of APP awards are determined
at the time of award and in compliance with regulatory requirements (which currently require
that at least 60% of total variable remuneration in respect of any year is deferred for between
three and seven years).
A proportion (which may be 100% for target performance) of APP is paid after the end of the
performance period. Where performance is above target, the remaining proportion may be
deferred in line with regulatory requirements.
Awards are normally paid in cash with a minimum of 50% of both the upfront and deferred
elements delivered in or linked to the market or fair value of the Society’s CCDS, or an
appropriate alternative instrument, and subject to a twelve-month retention period. Participants
will be entitled to the value of CCDS distributions (or equivalent) to the extent permitted by
regulations.

For awards made in respect of 2023/24, the target opportunity for D
Crosbie and C S Rhodes will be 67% of base salary, with a maximum
opportunity of 100% of base salary.

Performance measures:
Awards made in respect of 2023/24 align to our new strategic drivers
and will be subject to four equally weighted performance measures, as
follows:
• More rewarding relationships: Number of engaged customers
• Simply brilliant service: Customer Experience Score
• Continuous improvement: Total costs
• Beacon for mutual good: Heard good things about Nationwide
The above measures will account for 70% of the awards for our
executive directors, with 30% of the award based on individual
performance (including conduct and behaviours).
Gateway measures based on profit before tax, leverage ratio and
conduct risk will also apply.
Targets under the APP plan are commercially sensitive and so will be
disclosed, along with performance achieved, in next year’s report.

Opportunity

Subject to the achievement of satisfactory Society and individual
performance over the 2023/24 year, it is intended that LTPP awards
will be made at a maximum of 100% of salary.

Performance measures:
Forward-looking performance will be measured against a long-term
scorecard determined by the Committee on an annual basis and set to
align with the long-term strategic objectives of the Society.
The measures for the 2022/23 LTPP awards (for the performance
period 2023/24 to 2025/26) can be found on page 124. Targets for
the 2022/23 LTPP awards are commercially sensitive and so will be
disclosed, along with performance achieved, in the Annual Report and
Accounts 2026.
Details of the performance measures for the 2023/24 LTPP (for the
performance period 2024/25 to 2026/27) will be included in next
year’s remuneration report.

The normal maximum LTPP opportunity for the executive directors is 100% of base salary.
Normally, 67% of base salary is payable for target performance, and at the threshold level of
performance 33.5% of the award opportunity will be paid. No portion of the award will be paid
where threshold performance is not achieved.

Going Concern
The Group’s business activities and financial position, the
factors likely to affect its future development and performance,
its objectives and policies in managing the financial risks to
which it is exposed, and its capital, funding and liquidity
positions are set out in the Financial review and the Risk
report.
The directors have assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, with reference to current and anticipated
market conditions including the ongoing war in Ukraine and
increases in the cost of living. The Group’s projections, stress
testing and scenario analysis show that the Group will be able
to operate at adequate levels of both liquidity and capital for
the next 12 months. Furthermore, the Group’s capital ratios
and its total capital resources are comfortably in excess of
Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) requirements.
The directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in business for a period of at
least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated
financial statements and that it is therefore appropriate to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The directors are satisfied that the Annual Report and
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable, and provides the information necessary for
members and other stakeholders to assess the Group’s
position and performance, business model and strategy.
Details of the governance procedures that have been
embedded to support this can be found in the Audit
Committee report.
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Established by the Financial Stability Board in 2017, the TCFD
recommendations were designed to enable financial firms to
produce clear, comprehensive, high-quality disclosures on the
impacts of climate change. Further enhancements were made
in 2021, through issuance of guidance on climate-related
metrics, targets and transition plans. Nationwide publishes its
TCFD-aligned Climate-related Financial Disclosures annually,

alongside its preliminary results. Nationwide also provides
summary information consistent with the TCFD
recommendations in the Strategic Report within its Annual
Report and Accounts disclosure, aligned to the requirements
of the Companies Act.

Directors’ responsibilities in respect of accounting records
and internal control

Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF)

• Keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy the financial position of the Society and the Group
and which enable them to ensure that the Annual Report
and Accounts comply with the Building Societies Act 1986.

The EDTF, established by the Financial Stability Board,
published its report ‘Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks’
in October 2012, with an update in November 2015 covering
IFRS 9 expected credit losses. The Taskforce on Disclosures
about Expected Credit Losses (DECL), jointly established by the
Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Reporting Council and
the Prudential Regulation Authority, published its third report
in September 2022. EDTF and DECL recommendations are
reflected in either the Annual Report and Accounts or Pillar 3
Disclosures.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the disclosure guidance
and transparency rules
As required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the directors have
included a fair review of the business and a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The
directors confirm that, to the best of each director’s knowledge
and belief:
• The Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review
contained in the Strategic report include a fair review of
the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Group and Society. In addition, the Strategic
report contains a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties.
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards which have been
adopted for use within the UK, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the
Group and Society.

The directors are responsible for ensuring that the Society and
its connected undertakings:

• Take reasonable care to establish, maintain, document and
review such systems and controls as are appropriate to the
Society.
The directors have general responsibility for safeguarding the
assets of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this
report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are
unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that they
ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of
any relevant audit information and to establish that the
Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
The auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as external
auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Introduction and Managing risk

Risk report
Introduction
Effective risk management is critical to delivering our new purpose: Banking - but fairer, more rewarding, and for the good of society, and ensures that we keep our customers’ money safe and
secure. Nationwide adopts a prudent approach to risk management, taking only those risks which support our strategy and managing those risks rigorously through a consistent and robust
methodology.
All business activities involve some degree of risk. Nationwide's risk management processes ensure the risks that arise from its activities are appropriately managed by:
• identifying risks through a robust assessment of principal risks and uncertainties facing the Society, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency, or
liquidity, or increase the potential for customer harm;
• robust decision making, ensuring the right risks are taken, in a way that is considered and supports the strategy, maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct;
• ensuring the risks taken are understood, controlled, and managed appropriately; and
• maintaining an appropriate balance between delivering customer value and remaining a prudent and responsible lender.

Managing risk
Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF)
The Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) sets out the approach to risk management. The framework is based on eight principal risk categories, establishing risk appetite, and
implementing risk management through the three lines of defence model. The ERMF is underpinned by processes, policies and standards that are specific to individual risk categories and focus on
the responsibilities of key executives and risk practitioners. The outputs of the ERMF are governed through the Society’s risk committee structure.
The Board monitors the Society’s risk management and internal control systems and carries out an annual review of their effectiveness. Based on this year’s review, the Society has an adequate risk
framework in place and a broadly effective control environment. Their design has been and will continue to be enhanced, to ensure they remain fit for purpose and reflects changes to the internal
and external risk profile, allowing tailored responses to be developed where further maturity or improvements are considered appropriate. To ensure the ERMF remains fit for purpose, the
strengthening of the operational and conduct risk and control environment, including our economic crime and anti-money laundering controls, will continue to be a focus in 2023/24 and beyond.
A programme has been completed to develop further the organisation’s understanding of the most prominent risks and controls within key customer-facing processes. In addition, there is an
ongoing programme of work to support the management of economic crime obligations. Taken together, this work has enabled Nationwide to refine and develop its approach to the identification
and management of risk, and to build understanding of how learnings can be applied more broadly across other key processes.
Activity to support the new FCA Consumer Duty has seen Nationwide introduce a Good Outcomes Guide as part of the ERMF. A new requirement has also been included in the ERMF for all principal
risk categories to evidence how good outcomes are delivered, and how foreseeable harm to customers is prevented when assessing risk. A programme of work is ongoing to ensure full
preparedness for the Consumer Duty prior to when it becomes effective in July 2023.

Three lines of defence
Risk management activities are structured along a three lines of defence (3LoD) model. This approach has been tailored to reflect the Society’s size, complexity, and business model and led to the
creation of the Chief Controls Office (CCO) in 2020. The introduction of the CCO has enhanced Nationwide’s risk management structure through centralised training, delivery of Society-wide control
testing and coordination of risk management programmes.
Though everyone has a role to play in risk management, the overall responsibilities and accountabilities are outlined through this 3LoD model, as follows:

First line: Chief Controls Office

First line: Risk and control ownership
Responsibilities
Designing and running business
operations, owning and operating most
controls to manage the Society’s risks
and meet regulatory requirements.

Accountabilities
• Setting business objectives
• Defining risk appetite
• Identifying, owning and managing risks
• Implementing and maintaining regulatory compliance
• Adhering to the Society’s minimum standards for risk
management and associated policies

Responsibilities

management support to
allow business leaders to
discharge their risk and
control accountabilities.

Accountabilities
• Control governance and reporting
• Coordination of regulatory requests

Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks set out in the table below are the key risks relevant to the Society’s business model and achievement of its strategic objectives. Where under the control of Nationwide, these risks
have a defined risk appetite consisting of statements supported by metrics, including rationale, limits and triggers. The principal risks are further sub-divided into more detailed categories of risk, for
which management risk appetite is set in the context of the Board’s risk appetite. The relationship between principal risks and top and emerging risks is set out on page 65.

Further Detail

Credit risk

The risk of loss as a result of a customer or counterparty failing to meet their financial obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Nationwide is unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due and maintain
member and other stakeholder confidence. Funding risk is the risk that Nationwide is unable to maintain
diverse funding sources in wholesale and retail markets and manage retail funding risk that can arise from
excessive concentrations of higher risk deposits.
The risk that Nationwide fails to maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses throughout a full economic
cycle and sufficient to maintain the confidence of current and prospective investors, customers, the Board
and regulators.
The risk that the net value of, or net income arising from, the Society’s assets and liabilities is impacted as
a result of market price or rate changes.
The risk that the value of the pension schemes’ assets will be insufficient to meet the estimated liabilities,
creating a pension deficit.
The risk that achievable volumes or margins decline relative to the cost base, affecting the sustainability of
the business and the ability to deliver the strategy due to macro-economic, geopolitical, industry,
regulatory, competitor or other external events.

Credit risk – Overview

Credit risk – Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of a customer or counterparty failing to meet their financial obligations. Credit risk encompasses:
• borrower/counterparty risk – the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty failing to pay, or becoming increasingly likely not to pay the interest or principal on a loan, or on a financial
product, or for a service, on time;
• security/collateral risk – the risk of loss arising from deteriorating security/collateral quality;
• concentration risk – the risk of loss arising from insufficient diversification; and
• refinance risk – the risk of loss arising when a repayment of a loan or other financial product occurs later than originally anticipated.
Nationwide manages credit risk for the following portfolios:
Portfolio
Residential mortgages

Definition
Loans secured on residential property

Consumer banking

Unsecured lending comprising current account overdrafts, personal loans and credit cards

Commercial lending

Loans to registered social landlords, project finance loans made under the Private Finance Initiative and commercial real estate lending

Treasury

Treasury liquidity, derivatives and discretionary investment portfolios

Management of credit risk
Nationwide lend in a responsible, affordable and sustainable way to ensure safeguarding of members and the financial strength of the Society throughout the credit cycle. To this end, the Board Risk
Committee sets the level of risk appetite it is willing to take in pursuit of the Society’s strategy, which is articulated as Board risk appetite statements and underlying principles:
Safeguarding our customers and counterparties by lending responsibly
• Only lending to customers or counterparties who demonstrate that they can afford to borrow.
• Supporting customers buying mortgageable properties of wide-ranging types and qualities.
• Working with customers and counterparties to recover their financial position should there be a delay, or risk of delay, in meeting their financial obligations.
Safeguarding the Society’s financial performance, strength and reputation
• Managing asset quality so that losses through an economic cycle will not undermine profitability, financial strength and our standing with external stakeholders.
• Ensuring that no material segment of our lending exposes the Society to excessive loss.
• Proactively managing credit risk and complying with regulation.
Nationwide operates with a commitment to responsible lending and a focus on championing good conduct and fair outcomes. In this respect, the Society formulates appropriate credit criteria and
policies which are aimed at mitigating risk from individual transactions and ensuring that the Society’s credit risk exposure remains within risk appetite. Under a governed delegated mandate
structure from the Board Risk Committee, the Credit Committee, individual Material Risk Takers and underwriters holding personal lending mandates make credit decisions, based on a thorough
credit risk assessment, to ensure that customers are able to meet their obligations.

Credit risk – Overview (continued)

Credit risk – Overview (continued)

Credit risk is managed within the risk appetite set by the Board. Performance against this appetite is measured across a range of metrics, each with an absolute limit, and this is reported to Credit
Committee on a monthly basis. Corrective action is taken when metrics move towards or beyond these limits to ensure performance remains or returns to within appetite within an appropriate
timescale.
Nationwide is committed to helping customers who may anticipate or find themselves experiencing a period of financial difficulty, offering a range of forbearance options tailored to their individual
circumstances. Accounts in arrears, or where the borrower is in financial difficulty, are managed by specialist teams within Nationwide or referred to debt charities to ensure an optimal outcome for
our customers and the Society.
Forbearance
Forbearance occurs when concessions are made to the contractual terms of a loan when the customer is facing or about to face difficulties in meeting their financial commitments. A concession is
where the customer receives assistance, which could be a modification to the previous terms and conditions of a facility or a total or partial refinancing of debt, either mid-term or at maturity.
Requests for concessions are principally attributable to:
•
•
•

temporary cash flow problems;
breaches of financial covenants; or
an inability to repay at contractual maturity.

Consistent with the European Banking Authority reporting definitions, loans that meet the regulatory forbearance exit criteria are not reported as forborne. The concession events used to classify
balances subject to forbearance for residential mortgages, consumer banking and commercial lending are described in the relevant sections of this report.
Impairment provisions
Impairment provisions on financial assets are calculated on an expected credit loss (ECL) basis for assets held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). ECL
impairment provisions are based on an assessment of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD), discounted to give a net present value. Provision
calculations for retail portfolios are typically performed on a collective rather than individual loan basis. For collective assessments, whilst each loan will have an associated ECL calculation, the
calculation will be based on cohort level data for assets with shared credit risk characteristics (e.g. origination date, origination loan to value, term).
Impairment provisions are calculated using a three-stage approach depending on changes in credit risk since original recognition of the assets:
• an asset which is not credit impaired on initial recognition and has not subsequently experienced a significant increase in credit risk is categorised as being within stage 1, with a provision equal
to a 12-month ECL (losses arising on default events expected to occur within 12 months);
• where a loan’s credit risk increases significantly, it is moved to stage 2. The provision recognised is equal to the lifetime ECL (losses on default events expected to occur at any point during the
life of the asset);
• if a loan meets the definition of credit impaired, it is moved to stage 3 with a provision equal to its lifetime ECL.
For loans and advances held at amortised cost, the stage distribution and the provision coverage ratios are shown in this report for each individual portfolio. The provision coverage ratio is
calculated by dividing the provisions by the gross balances for each main lending portfolio. Loans remain on the balance sheet, net of associated provisions, until they are repaid or deemed no
longer recoverable, when such loans are written off.

Governance and oversight of impairment provisions
The models used in the calculation of impairment provisions are governed in accordance with the Society’s Model Risk Framework as described in the Model risk section of this report. PD, EAD and
LGD models are subject to regular monitoring and back testing and are reviewed annually. Where necessary, adjustments are approved for risks not captured in model outputs, for example where
insufficient historic data exists. The economic scenarios used in the calculation of impairment provisions and associated probability weightings are proposed by our Chief Economist. Details of these
economic assumptions and material adjustments are included in note 10 to the financial statements.
Governance and oversight of economic assumptions, weightings applied to economic scenarios and all key judgements relating to impairment provisions are through a formal monthly meeting
including the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer. Impairment provisions are regularly reported to the Audit Committee, which reviews and challenges the key
judgements and estimates made by management.
Performance overview
The UK economy has experienced a period of uncertainty, with rising energy prices driving an increase in the cost of living and contributing to a high inflationary environment throughout the year.
Additionally, increases to the Bank rate have increased the cost of borrowing and put further pressure on household affordability. Provisions have increased to £765 million (2022: £746 million)
which includes a modelled adjustment totalling £177 million (2022: £159 million) to reflect an increase to the probability of default to account for the combined risks of rising inflation, increasing
interest rates and credit indicators which are judged to be temporary, such as reduced levels of arrears.
Despite this, observed credit quality and performance have remained broadly stable. Performance has benefited from the impact of government energy support schemes, with residential mortgages
and consumer banking arrears remaining at a low level relative to recent years. Help and support continues to be provided for members who are struggling as a result of increases in their cost of
living, with concessions granted based on consideration of their individual circumstances.
The combined pressure of high inflation and rising interest rates has also led to a reduction in housing market activity, with a reduction in house prices of 3.1% in the year to March 2023.
Outlook
Continued pressure on personal finances is expected, with the level of government energy support reducing and inflation forecasted to return to the Bank of England 2% target in the medium rather
than short term. The Group’s base case economic scenario assumes that house prices will fall by 4.5% during 2023.

Maximum exposure to credit risk
Nationwide’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 4 April 2023 was £279 billion (2022: £284 billion).
Credit risk largely arises from loans and advances to customers, which account for 79% (2022: 78%) of Nationwide’s total credit risk exposure. Within this, the exposure relates primarily to
residential mortgages, which account for 95% (2022: 95%) of total loans and advances to customers and comprise high quality assets with historically low occurrences of arrears and
possessions.
In addition to loans and advances to customers, Nationwide is exposed to credit risk on all other financial assets. For all financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to
credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment, plus off-balance sheet commitments. For off-balance sheet commitments, the maximum exposure is the
maximum amount that Nationwide would have to pay if the commitments were to be called upon. For loan commitments and other credit-related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of
the respective facilities, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.

Notes:
i. In addition to the amounts shown above, Nationwide has revocable commitments of £10,444 million (2022: £10,622 million) in respect of credit card and overdraft facilities. These commitments represent
agreements to lend in the future, subject to certain considerations. Such commitments are cancellable by Nationwide, subject to notice requirements, and given their nature are not expected to be drawn down to the
full level of exposure.
ii. The fair value adjustment for portfolio hedged risk and the fair value adjustment for micro hedged risk (which relates to the commercial lending portfolio) represent hedge accounting adjustments.
iii. FVTPL residential mortgages include equity release and shared equity loans.

Commitments
Irrevocable undrawn commitments to lend are within the scope of provision requirements. The commitments in the table above consist of overpayment reserves and separately identifiable
irrevocable commitments for the pipeline of residential mortgages, personal loans, commercial loans and investment securities. These commitments are not recognised on the balance sheet; the
associated provision of £0.2 million (2022: £0.4 million) is included within provisions for liabilities and charges.
Revocable commitments relating to overdrafts and credit cards are included in the calculation of impairment provisions, with the allowance for future drawdowns included in the estimate of the

Credit risk – Residential mortgages
Summary
Nationwide’s residential mortgages comprise prime, buy to let and legacy loans. Prime residential mortgages are mainly Nationwide-branded advances made through intermediary channels and
the branch network. Since 2008 buy to let mortgages have only been originated under The Mortgage Works (UK) plc (TMW) brand. Legacy mortgages are smaller portfolios in run-off.
Arrears rates on the residential mortgage portfolios remain low. However, higher inflation and rising interest rates are placing greater pressure on household finances, increasing the potential for
future arrears.
There have been signs of a slowdown in activity in the housing market over the year with a reduction in house prices driving an increase in the average LTV of the residential portfolios to 55% (2022:
52%). Further information is included on page 157.

Balance sheet provisions have increased to £280 million (2022: £187 million). This includes a modelled adjustment totalling £77 million (2022: £13 million) to reflect an increase to the probability of
default to account for the combined risks of rising inflation, increasing interest rates and credit indicators which are judged to be temporary, such as reduced levels of arrears. The impairment
charge for the year reflects the increase in this adjustment, primarily due to expectations that higher mortgage interest rates will reduce borrower affordability. Further information is included in
note 10 to the financial statements. The impairment charge also reflects the impact of increased expected credit losses in the severe downside economic scenario, also as a result of higher interest
rate assumptions. The prior year impairment release reflected a decrease in provisions during a year where the economic outlook had improved.
The following table shows residential mortgage lending balances carried at amortised cost, the stage allocation of the loans, impairment provisions and the resulting provision coverage ratios.

Notes:
i. Days past due (DPD) is a measure of arrears status.
ii. POCI loans are those which were credit impaired on purchase or acquisition. The POCI loans shown in the table above were recognised on the balance sheet when the Derbyshire Building Society was acquired in
December 2008. These balances, which are mainly interest-only, were 90 days or more in arrears when they were acquired and so have been classified as credit impaired on acquisition. The gross balance for POCI is
shown net of the lifetime ECL on transition to IFRS 9 of £5 million (2022: £5 million).

Total residential mortgage provisions have increased to £280 million (2022: £187 million), with £82 million of this increase relating to buy to let and legacy mortgages. This provision increase is
largely the result of a deterioration in the economic outlook and increases to the provisions held for affordability risks in relation to rising inflation and higher interest rates.
Stage 2 loans total £35.5 billion (2022: £16.4 billion), which includes £16.6 billion (2022: £4.6 billion) of loans where the PD has been uplifted to recognise the increased risk of default in a period of
economic uncertainty. The total stage 2 increase is largely due to increasing affordability risks because of higher mortgage interest rates, in addition to the implementation of models which are
more responsive to the risks in the economic scenarios.
Credit performance continues to be strong. Stage 3 loans in the residential mortgage portfolio equate to 0.5% (2022: 0.6%) of the total residential mortgage exposure. Of the total £1,066 million
(2022: £1,224 million) stage 3 loans, £562 million (2022: £552 million) is in respect of loans which are more than 90 days past due, with the remainder being impaired due to other indicators of
unlikeliness to pay such as forbearance or the bankruptcy of the borrower. For loans subject to forbearance, accounts are transferred from stage 3 to stages 1 or 2 only after being up to date and
meeting contractual obligations for a period of 12 months; £179 million (2022: £346 million) of the stage 3 balances in forbearance are in this probation period.

Credit risk – Residential mortgages (continued)

Loans which are reported within stage 2 are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination, determined through both quantitative and qualitative indicators, as
shown in the table below.
Criteria
Quantitative

Detail
The primary quantitative indicators are the outputs of internal credit risk assessments. For residential mortgage exposures, PDs are derived using models, which use external
information such as that from credit reference agencies, as well as internal information such as known instances of arrears or other financial difficulty. Current and historical data
relating to the exposure are combined with forward-looking macroeconomic information to determine the likelihood of default. 12-month and lifetime PDs are calculated for each loan.
The 12-month and lifetime PDs are compared to pre-determined benchmarks at each reporting date to ascertain whether a relative or absolute increase in credit risk has occurred. The
indicators for a significant increase in credit risk are:

Qualitative

•

Absolute measures:
- The 12-month PD exceeds the benchmark 12-month PD that is indicative, at the assessment date, of an account being in arrears.
- The residual lifetime PD exceeds the benchmark residual lifetime PD, set at inception, which represents the maximum credit risk that would have been accepted at that point.

•

Relative measure:
- The residual lifetime PD has increased by at least 75 basis points and has at least doubled.

Qualitative indicators include the increased risk associated with interest only loans which may not be able to refinance at maturity.
Also included are forbearance events where full repayment of principal and interest is still anticipated, on a discounted basis.

Backstop

In addition to the primary criteria for stage allocation described above, accounts that are more than 30 days past due are also transferred to stage 2.

At 4 April 2023, stage 2 balances were £35,545 million (2022: £16,449 million). Of these, only 1% (2022: 2%) are in arrears by 30 days or more, with the majority of balances in stage 2 due to an
increase in PD since origination. This category includes £16.6 billion (2022: £4.6 billion) of loans where the modelled PD has been uplifted to recognise the increased risk of default in a period of
economic uncertainty, including the impact of higher interest rates on borrower affordability. The impact of this uplift in PD has resulted in these loans breaching existing quantitative PD thresholds.
Stage 2 loans include all loans greater than 30 days past due (DPD), including those where the original reason for being classified as stage 2 was other than arrears over 30 DPD. The total value of
loans in stage 2 due solely to payment status is less than 0.1% (2022: <0.1%) of total stage 2 balances.

The proportion of prime new lending from remortgages has increased to 24% (2022: 20%), reflecting a slower house purchase market alongside some remortgage activity likely to have been
brought forward due to the expected future path of interest rates. Buy to let lending reduced as a proportion of all new business to 17% (2022: 20%) as the volume of both house purchases and
remortgages in the buy to let market reduced due to rising interest rates.

Credit risk – Residential mortgages (continued)

Over the year, the geographical distribution of residential mortgages across the UK has remained stable. The highest concentration for both prime and buy to let portfolios is in Greater London,
with proportions broadly stable at 29% and 46% (2022: 30% and 46%) respectively.
In addition to balances held at amortised cost shown in the table above, £47 million (2022: £64 million) of residential mortgages are held at FVTPL. These have an average LTV of 35% (2022: 33%).
The largest geographical concentration within the FVTPL balances is also in Greater London, at 61% (2022: 57%) of total FVTPL balances.
Arrears and possessions
Residential mortgage lending continues to have a low risk profile as demonstrated by the low level of arrears compared to the industry average.

Notes:
i. The methodology for calculating mortgage arrears is based on the UKF definition of arrears, where
months in arrears is determined by dividing the arrears balance outstanding by the latest monthly
contractual payment.
ii. The UKF data shown for 2023 is as at December 2022 and the 2022 data is as at March 2022.

The proportion of cases more than 3 months in arrears has decreased during the year to 0.32% (2022: 0.34%). Arrears levels are expected to increase as a result of the rising cost of living, including
higher mortgage payments, but to remain low relative to the industry average.
The number of properties in possession has increased to 246 (2022: 159) as activity that was temporarily suspended during the pandemic has recommenced. The possession of a borrower’s
property is only undertaken where all reasonable attempts to resolve the situation have been unsuccessful.

The balance of cases past due by more than 3 months has remained broadly stable at £600 million (2022: £596 million).
As at 4 April 2023, the mortgage portfolios include 1,329 (2022: 1,924) mortgage accounts, including those in possession, where payments were more than 12 months in arrears. The total principal
outstanding in these cases was £147 million (2022: £215 million), and the total value of arrears was £26 million (2022: £30 million).

Interest only mortgages
At 4 April 2023, interest only balances of £6,812 million (2022: £7,824 million) account for 4% (2022: 5%) of prime residential mortgages. Nationwide re-entered the prime market for interest only
lending under a newly established credit policy in April 2020; however, 85% of current interest only mortgage balances relate to historical accounts which were originally advanced as interest only
mortgages or where a subsequent change in terms to an interest only basis was agreed. Maturities on interest only mortgages are managed closely, with regular engagement with borrowers to
ensure the loan is redeemed or to agree a strategy for repayment.
Of the buy to let and legacy portfolio, £40,126 million (2022: £39,591 million) relates to interest only balances, representing 91% (2022: 91%) of balances. Buy to let remains open to new interest
only lending under standard terms.
There is a risk that a proportion of interest only mortgages will not be redeemed at their contractual maturity date, because a borrower does not have a means of capital repayment or has been
unable to refinance the loan. Interest only loans which are judged to have a significantly increased risk of inability to refinance at maturity are transferred to stage 2. The ability of a borrower to
refinance is calculated using current lending criteria which consider LTV and affordability assessments. The impact of recognising this risk is to increase provisions by £45 million
(2022: £46 million).

Interest only loans that are term expired (still open) are not considered to be past due where contractual interest payments continue to be met, pending renegotiation of the facility. These loans are,
however, treated as credit impaired and categorised as stage 3 balances from three months after the maturity date.

Forbearance
Nationwide is committed to supporting borrowers facing financial difficulty by working with them to find a solution through proactive arrears management and forbearance.
The Group applies the European Banking Authority (EBA) definition of forbearance.
The following concession events are included within the forbearance reporting for residential mortgages:
Past term interest only concessions
Nationwide works with borrowers who are unable to repay the capital at term expiry of their interest only mortgage. Where a borrower is unable to renegotiate the facility within six months of
maturity, but no legal enforcement is pursued, the account is considered forborne. Should another concession event such as a term extension occur within the six month period, this is also classed
as forbearance.
Interest only concessions
Where a temporary interest only concession is granted the loans do not accrue arrears for the period of the concession and these loans are categorised as impaired.
Capitalisation
When a borrower emerges from financial difficulty, provided they have made at least six full monthly instalments, they are offered the option to capitalise arrears. This results in the account being
repaired and the loans are categorised as not impaired provided contractual repayments are maintained.
Capitalisation – temporary suspension of payments following notification of death of a borrower
On notification of death, we offer a 12-month capitalisation concession to allow time for the estate to redeem the account. The loan does not accrue arrears for the period of the concession although
interest will continue to be added. Accounts subject to this concession will be classed as forborne if the full contractual payment is not received.
Term extensions (within term)
Customers in financial difficulty may be allowed to extend the term of their mortgage. On a capital repayment mortgage this will reduce their monthly commitment; interest only borrowers will
benefit by having a longer period to repay the capital at maturity.
Permanent interest only conversions
In the past, some borrowers in financial difficulty were granted a permanent interest only conversion, normally reducing their monthly commitment. This facility was withdrawn in March 2012; it
remains available for buy to let lending in line with Nationwide’s new business credit policy.

Notes:
i. Where more than one concession event has occurred, balances are reported under the latest event.
ii. Includes interest only mortgages where a customer is unable to renegotiate the facility within six months of maturity and no legal enforcement is pursued. Should a concession event such as a term extension occur
within the six-month period, this will also be classed as forbearance.

The average LTV for forborne accounts is 47% (2022: 46%). In addition to the amortised cost balances above, £4 million of FVTPL balances (2022: £4 million) are also forborne.

Summary
The consumer banking portfolio comprises balances on unsecured retail banking products: overdrawn current accounts, personal loans and credit cards. Over the year, total balances across these
portfolios have reduced to £4,408 million (2022: £4,638 million) driven by reduced new business and a continued pay down of the existing book on personal loans.
Arrears levels have increased slightly during the year but remain low. High levels of inflation and rising interest rates will put pressure on household budgets, stretching affordability for some
borrowers. As a result, arrears levels are expected to increase over the short to medium term.

The lower impairment charge for the year ended 4 April 2023 reflects a release of provisions, which reduced to £469 million (2022: £529 million). Provisions include a modelled uplift to the
probability of default to reflect economic uncertainty. This adjustment increases provisions by £100 million (2022: £146 million), and reduced over the year due to a refinement to the estimated
impact of affordability risks.

Balance sheet provisions of £469 million (2022: £529 million) include a modelled adjustment of £100 million (2022: £146 million) to reflect an increase to the probability of default to account for the
combined risks of rising inflation, increasing interest rates and credit indicators which are judged to be temporary, such as reduced levels of arrears. This has resulted in £585 million (2022: £700
million) of balances being moved to stage 2. Further information is included in note 10.
Credit performance continues to be strong, with the proportion of total balances in stage 3 increasing slightly to 6.4% (2022: 5.9%). £25 million of overdrawn current account balances are included
in stage 3 due to these borrowers being granted a six-month 0% interest concession to support them with increased costs of living. Consumer banking stage 3 gross balances and provisions include
charged off balances. These are accounts which are closed to future transactions and are held on the balance sheet for an extended period (up to 36 months) whilst recovery activities take place.
Excluding these charged off balances and related provisions, provisions amount to 6.9% (2022: 7.6%) of gross balances.

Notes:
i. This category includes all loans greater than 30 DPD, including those whose original reason for being classified as stage 2 was not arrears over 30 DPD.
ii. Stage 2 forbearance relates to cases where full repayment of principal and interest is still anticipated.

Balances reported within stage 2 represent loans which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination. The significant increase is determined through both quantitative and
qualitative indicators. Of the £1,745 million (2022: £1,720 million) stage 2 balances, only 1% (2022: 1%) are in arrears by 30 days or more, with the majority of balances in stage 2 due to an increase
in PD since origination. This category includes £585 million (2022: £700 million) of loans where the modelled PD has been uplifted to recognise the increased risk of default in a high inflation and
interest rate environment. The impact of this uplift in PD has resulted in these loans breaching existing quantitative PD thresholds.

Credit risk – Consumer banking (continued)

The table below outlines the main criteria used to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination has occurred.
Criteria
Quantitative

Detail
The primary quantitative indicators are the outputs of internal credit risk assessments. For consumer banking exposures, PDs are derived using models, which use external information
such as that from credit reference agencies, as well as internal information such as known instances of arrears or other financial difficulty. Current and historical data relating to the
exposure are combined with forward-looking macroeconomic information to determine the likelihood of default. 12-month and lifetime PDs are calculated for each loan.
The 12-month and lifetime PDs are compared to pre-determined benchmarks at each reporting date to ascertain whether a relative or absolute increase in credit risk has occurred. The
indicators for a significant increase in credit risk are:
•

Absolute measures:
- The 12-month PD exceeds the benchmark 12-month PD that is indicative, at the assessment date, of an account being in arrears.
- The residual lifetime PD exceeds the benchmark residual lifetime PD, set at inception, which represents the maximum credit risk that would have been accepted at that point.

•

Relative measure:
- The residual lifetime PD has increased by at least 75 basis points and has at least doubled.

Qualitative

Qualitative criteria include both forbearance events and, within the credit card portfolio, recognition of the risk related to borrowers in persistent debt.

Backstop

In addition to the primary criteria for stage allocation described above, accounts that are more than 30 days past due are also transferred to stage 2.

Note:
i. Charged off balances relate to accounts which are closed to future transactions and are held on the balance sheet for an extended period (up to 36 months, depending on the product) whilst recovery procedures take
place.

Of total balances excluding charged off balances, £149 million (2022: £133 million) are subject to arrears, representing 3.5% (2022: 3.0%) of these balances. Arrears levels are expected to increase
further due to the affordability pressures which borrowers may face, due to high inflation and increasing interest rates.
Forbearance
Nationwide is committed to supporting customers facing financial difficulty by working with them to find a solution through proactive arrears management and forbearance.
The Group applies the European Banking Authority definition of forbearance.
The following concession events are included within the forbearance reporting for consumer banking:
Payment concession
This concession consists of reduced monthly payments over an agreed period and may be offered to customers with an overdraft or credit card. For credit cards subject to such a concession, arrears
do not increase provided the payments are made.

Other information

Interest suppressed payment arrangement
This temporary interest payment concession results in reduced monthly payments and may be offered to customers with an overdraft, credit card or personal loan. Interest payments and fees are
suppressed during the period of the concession and arrears do not increase. Cases subject to this concession are classified as impaired.
Balances re-aged/re-written
As customers repay their debt in line with the terms of their new arrangement, their accounts are re-aged, bringing them into an up-to-date and performing position. For personal loans we will
re-write the loan to extend the term and thus maintain a reduced monthly payment. For credit cards we re-age the account and set the payment status to ‘up-to-date’, at which point the customer
is treated in the same way as any other performing account.
The table below provides details of consumer banking balances subject to forbearance. Accounts that are currently subject to a concession are all assessed as either stage 2, or stage 3 (credit
impaired) where full repayment of principal and interest is no longer anticipated.
During the year, total balances subject to forbearance have increased to £79 million (2022: £60 million). This increase is largely the result of £25 million (2022: £nil) of overdrawn current accounts
being granted a six-month 0% interest rate concession to support borrowers with increased costs of living. This has been included in the interest suppressed payment concession line in the table
below.

Summary
The commercial portfolio comprises loans which have been provided to meet the funding requirements of registered social landlords, project finance initiatives and commercial real estate investors.
The project finance and commercial real estate portfolios are closed to new business and are in run-off. Total balances have therefore continued to reduce. Overall credit quality has remained stable.

Over the year, the performance of the commercial portfolio has remained stable, with 96% (2022: 96%) of balances in stage 1. Of the £167 million (2022: £156 million) stage 2 loans, which
represent 3.3% (2022: 2.9%) of total balances, £nil (2022: £7 million) were in arrears by 30 days or more.
Loans in the project finance portfolio benefit from long-term cash flows, which typically emanate from the provision of assets such as schools, hospitals, police stations, government buildings and
roads, procured under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). The stage 2 balance reflects a small number of borrowers affected by issues relating to underlying assets.
Repayment of loans has resulted in the reduction in stage 2 CRE loan balances. Write-offs and a reduction in asset values for remaining impaired loans has resulted in an overall decrease to CRE
stage 3 provisions to £6 million (2022: £13 million).

Credit quality
Nationwide applies robust credit management policies and processes to identify and manage the risks arising from the portfolio.
The CRE portfolio continues to be spread across the retail, office, residential investment, industrial and leisure sectors. Where a CRE loan is secured on assets crossing different sectors, the sector
allocation is based upon the value of the underlying assets in each sector. For the CRE portfolio the largest exposure is to the residential sector, which represents 39% (2022: 40%) of total CRE
balances, with a weighted average LTV of 35% (2022: 34%). Exposure to office assets has reduced to 21% (2022: 23%) of total CRE balances, with a weighted average LTV of 64% (2022: 58%).
The LTV distribution of CRE balances has remained stable with 91% (2022: 91%) of the portfolio having an LTV of 75% or less, and 47% (2022: 61%) of the portfolio having an LTV of 50% or less.
CRE balances with arrears have reduced to £18 million (2022: £44 million). Of these, £10 million (2022: £24 million) have arrears greater than 3 months and relate to loans that are in recovery or
are being actively managed.

The risk grades in the table above are based upon the IRB supervisory slotting approach for specialised lending exposures. Exposures are classified into categories depending on the underlying
credit risk, with the assessment based upon financial strength, property characteristics, strength of sponsor and any other forms of security. The credit quality of the CRE portfolio has remained
stable with 85% (2022: 84%) of the portfolio balances rated as strong, good or satisfactory.
Risk grades for the project finance portfolio use the same slotting approach as for CRE lending, with 85% (2022: 90%) of the exposure rated strong or good.
The registered social landlord portfolio is risk rated using an internal PD rating model, with the major drivers being financial strength, evaluations of the borrower’s oversight and management, and
their type and size. The distribution of exposures is weighted towards the stronger risk ratings and against a backdrop of zero defaults in the portfolio, the credit quality remains high, with an
average 12-month PD of 0.04% (2022: 0.03%) across the portfolio.

Forbearance
Nationwide is committed to supporting borrowers facing financial difficulty by working with them to find a solution through proactive arrears management and forbearance.
Forbearance is recorded and reported at borrower level and applies to all commercial lending, including impaired exposures and borrowers subject to enforcement and recovery action. The Group
applies the European Banking Authority definition of forbearance.

Credit risk – Treasury assets
Summary
The treasury portfolio is held primarily for liquidity management and, in the case of derivatives, for market risk management. As at 4 April 2023 treasury assets represented 23.2% (2022: 23.3%) of
total assets. There are no exposures to emerging markets, hedge funds or credit default swaps. The classification of treasury asset balances is set out below.

Notes:
i. Investment securities at FVOCI include £44 million (2022: £46 million) and investment securities at FVTPL include £13 million (2022: £17 million) which relate to investments not included within the Group’s liquidity
portfolio. These investments primarily relate to investments made in Fintech companies which are being held for strategic purposes.
ii. Derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative. As at 4 April 2023, derivative liabilities were £1,524 million (2022: £1,428 million).

Cash held in the treasury portfolio has decreased to £25.6 billion (2022: £30.2 billion) and reflects the early repayment of £4.5 billion of the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme with additional
incentives for SMEs (TFSME). Investment activity remains focused on high quality liquid assets, including assets eligible for central bank operations. Fixed rate investment securities are fully
swapped to floating rate receipts for the duration of the holding. The increase in investment securities in the year of £2.2 billion is largely attributable to increased holdings of government and
supranational bonds. The £40 million of investment securities classified as amortised cost are residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), which are expected to have paid down fully by
December 2024. Derivatives are used to economically hedge financial risks inherent in core lending and funding activities, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Managing treasury credit risks
Credit risk within the treasury portfolio arises from the instruments held and transacted by the Treasury function for operational, liquidity and investment purposes. In addition, counterparty credit
risk arises from the use of derivatives to reduce exposure to market risks; these are only transacted with highly-rated organisations and are collateralised under market standard documentation. The
Treasury Credit Risk function manages all aspects of credit risk in accordance with Nationwide’s risk governance frameworks, under the supervision of the Credit Committee.
A monthly review is undertaken of the current and expected performance of treasury assets that determines expected credit loss (ECL) provision requirements. There were no impairment losses for
the year ended 4 April 2023 (2022: £nil). For financial assets held at amortised cost or at FVOCI, all exposures within the table below are classified as stage 1, reflecting the strong and stable credit
quality of treasury assets.

Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are used to manage exposure to market risks, and not for trading or speculative purposes, although the application of accounting rules can create volatility in the income statement in a
given financial year. The fair value of derivative assets as at 4 April 2023 was £6.9 billion (2022: £4.7 billion) and the fair value of derivative liabilities was £1.5 billion (2022: £1.4 billion).
Nationwide, as a direct member of a central counterparty (CCP), has central clearing capability which it uses to clear standardised derivatives. Where derivatives are not cleared at a CCP they are
transacted under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. A Credit Support Annex (CSA) is always executed in conjunction with the ISDA Master Agreement.
Under the terms of a CSA collateral is passed between parties to mitigate the market-contingent counterparty risk inherent in the outstanding positions. CSAs are two-way agreements where both
parties post collateral dependent on the exposure of the derivative. Collateral is paid or received on a regular basis (typically daily) to mitigate the mark-to-market exposures. Market standard CSA
collateral allows GBP, EUR and USD cash, and in some cases extends to high grade sovereign debt securities; both cash and securities can be held as collateral by the Society.
Nationwide’s CSA documentation for derivatives grants legal rights of set-off for transactions with the same counterparty. Accordingly, the credit risk associated with such positions is reduced to the
extent that negative mark-to-market values offset positive mark-to-market values in the calculation of credit risk within each netting agreement.
Under the terms of CSA netting agreements, outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and settled on a net basis following a default, or another predetermined event. Under
these arrangements, netting benefits of £1.3 billion (2022: £1.3 billion) were available and £5.6 billion (2022: £3.5 billion) of collateral was held.
This table shows the exposure to counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts after netting benefits and collateral.

Liquidity and funding risk

Liquidity and funding risk
Summary
Liquidity risk is the risk that Nationwide is unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due and maintain member and external stakeholder confidence. Funding risk is the risk that Nationwide is unable
to maintain diverse funding sources in wholesale and retail markets and manage excessive concentrations of funding types.
Liquidity and funding risks are managed within a comprehensive risk framework which includes policies, strategy, limit setting and monitoring, stress testing and robust governance controls. This
framework ensures that Nationwide maintains stable and diverse funding sources and a sufficient holding of high-quality liquid assets such that there is no significant risk that liabilities cannot be
met as they fall due.
Nationwide’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which ensures that sufficient high-quality liquid assets are held to survive a short-term severe but plausible liquidity stress, averaged 180%
over the 12 months ended 4 April 2023 (2022: 183%). Nationwide continues to manage its liquidity against internal risk appetite which is more prudent than regulatory requirements, and under the
most severe internal 30 calendar day stress test, the average ratio of the liquid asset buffer to stressed net outflows over the 12 months ended 4 April 2023 equated to 155% (2022: 159%).
The position against the longer-term funding metric, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), is also monitored. Nationwide’s average NSFR for the four quarters ended 4 April 2023 was 147%
(2022: 146%), well in excess of the 100% minimum requirement.

At 4 April 2023, Nationwide’s loan to deposit ratio, which represents loans and advances to customers divided by the total of shares and other deposits, was 109.6% (2022: 113.6%). Included within
shares and other deposits, which are reported in the retail and wholesale funding categories above, is £29 billion of deposits (4 April 2022: £26 billion) that exceed the £85,000 per customer Financial
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) limit.

Wholesale funding
The wholesale funding portfolio comprises a range of secured and unsecured instruments to ensure that a stable and diversified funding base is maintained across a range of instruments,
currencies, maturities, and investor types. Part of Nationwide’s wholesale funding strategy is to remain active in core markets and currencies. A funding risk limit framework also ensures that a
prudent funding mix and maturity concentration profile is maintained and limits the level of encumbrance to ensure enough contingent funding capacity is retained in the event of a stress.
Wholesale funding has decreased by £9.4 billion to £57.9 billion during the year. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in balances relating to repurchase (repo) agreements and a £4.5 billion
reduction in holdings from the Bank of England’s Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), which is partially offset by a £2.1 billion net increase in secured and unsecured
funding issuances during the period. The wholesale funding ratio (on-balance sheet wholesale funding as a proportion of total funding liabilities) at 4 April 2023 was 25.0% (2022: 28.8%).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity strategy
The Society’s risk appetite, as set by the Board, defines the size and mix of the liquid asset buffer, and is translated into a set of liquidity risk limits. Sufficient liquid assets, both in terms of amount
and quality, are held to meet daily cash flow needs as well as simulated stressed requirements driven by the Society’s risk appetite and regulatory assessments. This includes prudent management
of the currency mix of liquid assets to ensure there is no undue reliance on currencies not consistent with the profile of stressed outflows.
Liquid assets are held and managed centrally by the Treasury function. A high-quality liquidity portfolio is maintained, predominantly comprising reserves held at central banks and highly-rated debt
securities issued by a restricted range of governments, central banks and supranationals.
Nationwide also holds a portfolio of high-quality, central bank-eligible covered bonds, residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and asset-backed securities. Other securities are held that are
not eligible for central bank operations but can be monetised through repo agreements with third parties or through sale.
Nationwide undertakes securities financing transactions in the form of repo agreements. This demonstrates the liquid nature of the assets held in its liquid asset buffer as well as satisfying
regulatory requirements. Cash is borrowed in return for pledging assets as collateral and because settlement is on a simultaneous ‘delivery versus payment’ basis, the main credit risk arises from
intra-day changes in the value of the collateral. This is largely mitigated by Nationwide’s collateral management processes.
Repo market capacity is regularly assessed and tested to ensure there is sufficient capacity to monetise the liquid asset buffer rapidly in a stress.
For contingency purposes, Nationwide pre-positions unencumbered mortgage assets at the Bank of England which can be used in the Bank of England’s liquidity operations if market liquidity is
severely disrupted.
Nationwide has met its most recent investment target of holding £1.5 billion of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) assets and will maintain a minimum holding of £1.5 billion for 2023/24.
The investment criteria for ESG assets remains restricted to bonds issued by multilateral development banks and green issuances from selected governments.

Notes:
i. The analysis excludes certain financial assets and liabilities relating to accruals, trade receivables, trade payables and settlement balances which are generally short-term in nature and lease liabilities. Further
information on lease liabilities is shown in note 28 to the financial statements.
ii. Due less than one month includes amounts repayable on demand.
iii. The principal amount for undated subscribed capital is included within the due after more than five years column.
iv. Off-balance sheet commitments include amounts payable on demand for undrawn loan commitments, customer overpayments on residential mortgages where the borrower can draw down the amount overpaid, and
commitments to acquire financial assets.

In practice, customer behaviours mean that liabilities are often retained for longer than their contractual maturities and assets are repaid earlier. This gives rise to funding mismatches on the
balance sheet. The balance sheet structure and risks are managed and monitored by Nationwide’s Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO). Judgement and past behavioural performance of each
asset and liability class are used to forecast likely cash flow requirements.

Financial liabilities – gross undiscounted contractual cash flows
The tables below provide an analysis of gross contractual cash flows. The totals differ from the analysis of residual maturity as they include estimated future interest payments, calculated using
balances outstanding at the balance sheet date, contractual maturities, and appropriate forward-looking interest rates.
Amounts are allocated to the relevant maturity band based on the timing of individual contractual cash flows.

Notes:
i. Due less than one month includes amounts repayable on demand.
ii. The principal amount for undated subscribed capital is included within the due more than five years column.
iii. Off-balance sheet commitments include amounts payable on demand for undrawn loan commitments, customer overpayments on residential mortgages where the borrower is able to draw down the amount
overpaid and commitments to acquire financial assets.

Asset encumbrance
Encumbrance arises where assets are pledged as collateral against secured funding and other collateralised obligations and therefore cannot be used for other purposes. The majority of asset
encumbrance arises from the use of prime mortgage pools to collateralise the Covered Bond and securitisation programmes (further information is included in note 14 to the financial statements)
and from participation in the Bank of England’s TFSME.
Certain unencumbered assets are readily available to secure funding or meet collateral requirements. These include prime mortgages and cash and securities held in the liquid asset buffer. Other
unencumbered assets, such as non-prime mortgages, are capable of being encumbered with a degree of further management action. Assets which do not fall into either of these categories are
classified as not being capable of being encumbered.

Liquidity and funding risk (continued)

Managing liquidity and funding risk
Nationwide’s management of liquidity and funding risks aims to ensure that there are sufficient liquid assets at all times, both as to amount and quality, to:
• cover cash flow mismatches and fluctuations in funding;
• retain public confidence; and
• meet financial obligations as they fall due, even during episodes of stress.
This is achieved through the management and stress testing of business cash flows, and through the translation of Board risk appetite into appropriate risk limits. This ensures a prudent funding
mix and maturity profile, sufficient levels of high-quality liquid assets, and appropriate encumbrance levels are maintained.
The liquidity and funding risk framework is reviewed by the Board as part of the annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). ALCO is responsible for managing the balance
sheet structure, including the Funding Plan, and its risks. This includes setting and monitoring more granular limits within Board limits. A consolidated cash flow forecast is maintained and
reviewed weekly to support ALCO in monitoring key risk metrics.
A Liquidity Contingency Plan (LCP), which is part of the wider recovery plan framework, is maintained which describes early warning triggers for indicating an emerging liquidity or funding stress as
well as escalation procedures and a range of actions that could be taken in response to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained. The LCP is tested annually to ensure it remains robust. Nationwide’s
Recovery Plan describes potential actions that could be utilised in a more extreme stress.
Liquidity stress testing
To mitigate liquidity and funding risks generated by its business activities, Nationwide aims to maintain a liquid asset buffer of at least 100% of the anticipated outflows seen under internal stress
test scenarios and the regulatory-prescribed LCR.
Potential contractual and behavioural stress outflows are assessed across a range of liquidity risk drivers over 30 calendar days, with the key assumptions shown below. An assessment over three
months is also performed against which LCP capacity is assessed. Internal stress assumptions are reviewed regularly with changes approved by ALCO and approved annually by the Board as part of
the ILAAP.
Liquidity risk driver
Retail funding

Modelling assumptions used
Significant unexpected outflows are experienced with no new deposits received.

Wholesale funding

Intra-day

Following a credit rating downgrade:
• zero roll-over of maturing long-term wholesale funding;
• zero roll-over of maturing short-term funding received from financial counterparties and partial roll-over from non-financial counterparties; and
• no new wholesale funding received.
Contractual outflows occur in relation to secured funding programmes due to credit rating downgrades.
Lending commitments continue to be met.
Collateral outflows arise due to adverse movements in market rates.
Expected inflows from mortgages or retail and commercial loans are recognised.
Liquidity is needed to pre-fund outgoing payments.

Liquid assets

Asset values are reduced in recognition of the stressed conditions assumed.

The contractually required cash outflow would not necessarily match the actual cash outflow as a result of management actions that could be taken to reduce the impact of the downgrades.
Outlook
Nationwide continues to hold a diversified high-quality liquid asset buffer which will evolve in line with Nationwide’s liquidity requirements. Nationwide’s funding plans include the refinancing of
TFSME through a continued presence in wholesale funding markets.

Capital risk

Risk report (continued)

Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that Nationwide fails to maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses throughout a full economic cycle and sufficient to maintain the confidence of current and prospective
investors, customers, the Board and regulators. Capital is held to protect customers, cover inherent risks, provide a buffer for stress events and support the business strategy. In assessing the
adequacy of capital resources, risk appetite is considered in the context of the material risks to which Nationwide is exposed and the appropriate strategies required to manage those risks.
Managing capital risk
The Board is responsible for setting risk appetite with respect to capital risk, which is articulated through its risk appetite statements, and it defines minimum levels of capital, including leverage,
that it is willing to operate with. These are translated into specific risk metrics, which are monitored by the Board Risk Committee (BRC), the Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) and other
internal management reviews.
The capital structure is managed to ensure that the minimum regulatory requirements and the expectations of other key stakeholders continue to be met. As part of the risk appetite framework,
strong capital ratios are targeted relative to both regulatory requirements and major banking peers. Any planned changes to the balance sheet, potential regulatory developments and other factors
(such as trading outlook, movements in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve and defined benefit pension deficit) are all considered.
The capital strategy is to manage capital ratios through retained earnings, supplemented by external capital where appropriate. With general reserves forming the majority of capital resources,
profitability is an important factor when considering the ability to meet capital requirements. A return on capital framework is in place, based upon an allocation of overall capital requirements,
which forms part of the Society’s Board risk appetite metrics as well as its performance monitoring activity for individual product segments. In recent years, Nationwide’s ability to supplement
retained earnings through the issuance of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1 (AT1) and Tier 2 capital instruments has been demonstrated. Over the past year, in line with Nationwide’s
capital management practises, opportunities have been taken to reduce excess capital resources through liabilities and equity management exercises, including a Tier 2 buyback of £0.7 billion in
June 2022 and a CCDS buyback of £0.1 billion in February 2023.
Capital is held to meet Pillar 1 requirements for credit, counterparty credit and operational risks. In addition, the PRA requires firms to hold capital to meet Pillar 2A requirements, which form an
Individual Capital Requirement (ICR). This is a point in time estimate, set by the PRA on an annual basis, based on the submission of the results of the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment
Process (ICAAP). This process confirms the amount of capital required to be held to meet risks partly covered by Pillar 1 such as credit concentration and operational risk, and risks not covered by
Pillar 1 such as pension and interest rate risk. The combination of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements form Nationwide’s Total Capital Requirement (TCR).
Nationwide’s latest Pillar 2A ICR and TCR were received in February 2023. The ICR is £2.3 billion, of which at least £1.3 billion must be met by CET1 capital. Nationwide’s ICR was equivalent to 4.5%
of risk weighted assets (RWAs) at 4 April 2023 (2022: 5.4% of RWA). This largely reflects the low average risk weight, given that approximately 82% (2022: 82%) of total assets, excluding central
bank reserves, are in the form of secured residential mortgages. The Pillar 2A ICR is set to a percentage of RWAs, having previously been set to a nominal amount during the year ended 4 April 2022
in response to the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.
To protect against the risk of consuming Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements (thereby breaching TCR), firms are subject to regulatory capital buffers which are set out in UK Capital Requirements
Directive V (UK CRD V). The PRA may set an additional firm-specific PRA buffer based upon supervisory judgement informed by the results of the Bank of England’s stress testing scenarios. This
assessment considers the impacts on a firm’s capital requirements and resources and other factors including leverage, systemic importance and any weaknesses in firms’ risk management and
governance procedures. The ICAAP also considers appropriate internal capital buffers to ensure that the impact of a severe but plausible stress can be absorbed.
Regular stress tests are undertaken, covering Nationwide and its subsidiaries, to enhance the understanding of potential vulnerabilities and how management actions might be deployed in the event
of stressed conditions developing. These stress tests project capital resources and requirements over a multi-year period, during severe but plausible scenarios that cover a range of macro-economic
or market-wide stresses, and idiosyncratic scenarios that test particular risks to Nationwide’s business model. Stress test results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.
Nationwide aims to be in a position to maintain strong capital and leverage ratios in the event of a severe but plausible economic or idiosyncratic stress. Embedded in the risk appetite framework is
an expectation to maintain CET1 and leverage ratios in excess of regulatory minima under stressed conditions.

Nationwide maintains a recovery plan under UK regulatory rules implementing the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). This contains a set of management actions that would
be available to support Nationwide’s capital and liquidity position in the event of a breach of one or more of the Group’s internal risk appetite metrics. In September 2021, Nationwide submitted its
first resolvability self-assessment to the Bank of England. This documented the capabilities that have been developed to achieve the resolvability outcomes as prescribed within the Bank of England
Resolvability Assessment Framework. A summary of Nationwide’s approach to resolvability is available within the Resolvability Assessment Framework public disclosure 2022 at nationwide.co.uk.
The next self-assessment submission will be made in October 2023 with public disclosures to follow in June 2024.
In January 2021 the Bank of England announced the Solvency Stress Test (SST) which the major UK banks and building societies undertook. The purpose was to use the results as a cross-check on
the Financial Policy Committee’s (FPC’s) judgement of how severe the current stress would need to be in order to jeopardise banks’ resilience and challenge their ability to absorb losses and
continue to lend. In December 2021 the results from the SST were published by the Bank of England. The macroeconomic scenario underlying the SST was a severe path for the economy in 2021–25
on top of the economic shock associated with the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020. Nationwide’s low point CET1 ratio through the scenario was 17.0%, which was in excess of those of our
peers, showing we are well capitalised and positioned to meet stressed economic conditions. The leverage ratio low point was 5.0% remaining in excess of the 3.6% regulatory requirement at that
time.
The Bank of England returned to the Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS) Stress Test framework in September 2022. This followed two years of Covid-19 pandemic crisis-related stress testing and its
decision to postpone the test in March 2022 due to the conflict in Ukraine. The 2022 ACS tested the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global
economies, large falls in asset prices and higher global interest rates, and a separate stress of misconduct costs. The results are due to be published by the Bank of England in the summer of 2023.
There were key regulatory changes that came into effect from 1 January 2022 that impact the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) models used to derive minimum capital requirements. These changes
formed part of the PRA’s updates to SS11/13 ‘IRB approaches’ some of which aim to increase consistency of approaches across different firms and reduce volatility on mortgage risk weights across
differing economic conditions. Nationwide’s mortgage IRB models have been redeveloped in order to meet the revised regulatory requirements, although the models are yet to be finalised and
approved by the PRA. Until approved, a model adjustment continues to be made in line with the prior year to ensure outcomes are consistent with the revised IRB regulations. The impact of the
model adjustment is a £21.4 billion increase in risk weighted assets. In line with other industry participants, we continue to work with the PRA on the precise calibration of the revised IRB models.

Risk-based capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements with the CET1 ratio at 26.5% (2022: 24.1%), above Nationwide’s CET1 capital requirement of 11.5%. The CET1 capital
requirement includes a 7.0% minimum Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirement and the UK CRD V combined buffer requirements of 4.5% of RWAs.
The CET1 ratio increased to 26.5% (2022: 24.1%) as a result of an increase in CET1 capital of £1.3 billion, in conjunction with a reduction in RWAs of £0.1 billion. The CET1 capital resources increase
was driven by £1.7 billion profit after tax, partially offset by £0.2 billion of capital distributions, a £0.1 billion CET1 deduction following the repurchase of CCDS in February 2023, and a £0.1 billion
reduction in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve. RWAs reduced, with an increase in residential mortgage lending being more than offset by a reduction in off-balance sheet
commitments.
UK CRD V requires firms to calculate a leverage ratio, which is non-risk based, to supplement risk-based capital requirements. Nationwide’s leverage ratio is 6.0% (2022: 5.4%), with Tier 1 capital
increasing by £1.3 billion as a result of the CET1 capital movements outlined above. In addition, there was a decrease in leverage exposure of £6.1 billion driven by the same movements as described
above for RWAs.
The leverage ratio remains in excess of Nationwide’s leverage capital requirement of 4.0%, which comprises a minimum Tier 1 capital requirement of 3.25% and buffer requirements of 0.75%. The
buffer requirements include a 0.4% UK countercyclical leverage ratio buffer in-force from 13 December 2022, which will increase to 0.7% in July 2023.
Leverage requirements continue to be Nationwide’s binding Tier 1 capital constraint, as the combination of minimum and regulatory buffer requirements are in excess of the risk-based equivalent.
The risk of excessive leverage is managed through regular monitoring and reporting of the leverage ratio, which forms part of risk appetite.
Further details on the leverage exposure can be found in the Group’s annual Pillar 3 Disclosure 2023 at nationwide.co.uk

Notes:
i. The CCDS amount does not include the £101 million deduction for the Group’s repurchase exercise completed in February 2023. This is presented separately as a regulatory adjustment in line with UK CRR article 42.
Further information is included in note 31 to the financial statements.
ii. A temporary adjustment to mitigate the impact of volatility in central government debt on capital ratios, in line with the Covid-19 banking package. This temporary relief was no longer applicable from 1 January 2023.
iii. In accordance with UK CRR article 33, institutions do not include the fair value reserves related to gains or losses on cash flow and other hedges of financial instruments that are not valued at fair value.
iv. Foreseeable distributions in respect of CCDS and AT1 securities are deducted from CET1 capital under UK CRD V rules.
v. A prudent valuation adjustment (PVA) is applied in respect of fair valued instruments as required under regulatory capital rules.
vi. Own credit and debit valuation adjustments are applied to remove balance sheet gains or losses of fair valued liabilities and derivatives that result from changes in own credit standing and risk, as per UK CRD V rules.
vii. Intangible, goodwill and defined benefit pension fund assets are deducted from capital resources after netting associated deferred tax liabilities.
viii.Where capital expected loss exceeds accounting provisions, the excess balance is removed from CET1 capital, gross of tax. In contrast, where provisions exceed capital expected loss, the excess amount is added to
Tier 2 capital, gross of tax. This calculation is not performed for equity exposures, in line with Article 159 of UK CRR. The expected loss amounts for equity exposures are deducted from CET1 capital, gross of tax.

ix. The IFRS 9 transitional adjustments to capital resources apply scaled relief until 4 April 2023 due to the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9; the period for these adjustments was extended by the PRA for a further
two years due to anticipated increases in expected credit losses as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Further detail is provided in the Group’s annual Pillar 3 disclosure 2023 at nationwide.co.uk
x. Where relevant provisions do not sufficiently cover non-performing exposures, the shortfall is deducted from CET1 capital, in line with Article 47c of the UK CRR.
xi. Subordinated debt includes fair value adjustments relating to changes in market interest rates, adjustments for unamortised premiums and discounts that are included in the consolidated balance sheet, and any
amortisation of the capital value of Tier 2 instruments required by regulatory rules for instruments with fewer than five years to maturity.

As part of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the Bank of England, in its capacity as the UK resolution authority, has published its policy for setting the minimum requirement for own funds
and eligible liabilities (MREL). From 1 January 2023, Nationwide’s requirement is to hold twice the minimum capital requirements (6.5% of leverage exposure), plus the applicable capital
requirement buffers, which amount to 0.7% of leverage exposure. This equals a total loss-absorbing requirement of 7.2%.
At 4 April 2023, total MREL resources were 8.8% (2022: 8.4%) of leverage exposure, in excess of the loss-absorbing requirement of 7.2% described above.
Risk weighted assets
The table below shows the breakdown of risk weighted assets (RWAs) by risk type and business activity. Market risk has been set to zero as permitted by the UK CRR, as the exposure is below the
threshold of 2% of own funds.

i. This column includes credit risk exposures, securitisations, counterparty credit risk exposures and exposures below the thresholds for deduction that are subject to a 250% risk weight.
ii. RWAs have been allocated according to the business lines within the standardised approach to operational risk, as per article 317 of UK CRR.
iii. Counterparty credit risk relates to derivative financial instruments, securities financing transactions (repurchase agreements) and exposures to central counterparties.
iv. Other relates to equity, fixed, intangible software and other assets.

RWAs reduced by £0.1 billion, partially due to a £0.3 billion decrease in retail mortgage credit risk RWAs. This was driven by a reduction in off-balance sheet commitments linked to a decrease in
applications, which more than offset the impact of an increase in net mortgage lending. Commercial loan credit risk RWAs also reduced, primarily due to a decrease in the size of the commercial
loan portfolio. Retail unsecured lending credit risk RWAs increased due to a six-month 0% interest rate concession provided to a number of overdrawn current accounts, to support borrowers
through cost of living pressures. Operational risk RWAs increased due to rising average income in the previous three financial years.

In line with the prior year, a model adjustment continues to be included within RWAs to ensure outcomes are consistent with the revised IRB regulations in force from 1 January 2022. The impact of
this is a £21.4 billion (2022: £21.8 billion) increase in risk weighted assets, predominantly in relation to retail mortgages. In line with other industry participants, Nationwide continues to engage with
the PRA regarding approval and implementation timings.
More detailed analysis of RWAs is included in the Group’s annual Pillar 3 Disclosure 2023 at nationwide.co.uk
IRB model risk
The performance and accuracy of IRB models is critical to the calculation of credit risk capital requirements. The effectiveness of the models is achieved through clear allocation and segregation of
roles and responsibilities covering model ownership, approval and governance, ongoing model monitoring, review and independent validation. Further information can be found in the
‘Use of the IRB Approach to credit risk’ section of the Group’s annual Pillar 3 Disclosure at nationwide.co.uk
Outlook – regulatory developments
Key areas of regulatory change are set out below. Nationwide will remain engaged in the development of the regulatory approach to ensure it is prepared for any resulting change.
The Basel Committee published its final reforms to the Basel III framework in December 2017, now denoted by the PRA as Basel 3.1. The amendments include changes to the standardised
approaches for credit and operational risks, including the introduction of an RWA standardised output floor to restrict the use of internal models. On 30 November 2022, the Bank of England issued
CP16/22 ‘Implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards’. The consultation paper, although materially similar to the original Basel reforms, includes interpretations and some divergences.
The reforms may lead to an increase in Nationwide’s RWAs relative to the current position, mainly due to the application of the standardised RWA output floor. The expected implementation date is
1 January 2025, with a phased introduction of the standardised RWA output floor until fully implemented by 2030. Based on Nationwide’s latest interpretation of the draft rules, there will not be a
material day-one impact on Nationwide’s CET1 ratio.
Nationwide’s CET1 ratio would reduce to a low-to-mid 20% range compared to the 26.5% reported at 4 April 2023, if the 2030 fully implemented standardised RWA output floor was overlaid.
However, final impacts are uncertain as they are subject to future balance sheet size and mix and the rules are currently at the consultation stage.
On 13 December 2022 the FPC confirmed its intention to increase the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate to 2% from 5 July 2023. This will lead to an increase in Nationwide’s risk-based
capital requirements. Nationwide’s leverage requirements will also increase as the countercyclical leverage ratio buffer is calculated as approximately 35% of the risk-based CCyB rate. Capital
surpluses will reduce as a result of these changes; however, they will remain comfortably above Board risk appetite based on current forecasts.

Market risk
Summary
Market risk is the risk that the net value of, or net income arising from, assets and liabilities is impacted as a result of changes in market prices or rates, specifically interest rates or currency rates.
Nationwide has limited appetite for market risk and does not have a trading book. Market risk is closely monitored and managed to ensure the level of risk remains within appetite. Market risks are
not taken unless they are essential to core business activities and they provide stability of earnings, minimise costs or enable operational efficiency.
The principal market risks that affect Nationwide are listed below together with the types of risk reporting measures used:
Market risk
exposure
Interest rate risk

Definition

Reporting measure

The impact of market movements in interest rates, which affects interest rate margin realised from lending and borrowing
activities. Volatility in short-term interest rates can also impact net income contribution from rate insensitive liabilities.

Value sensitivity / Value at risk / Net interest
income sensitivity / Economic value of equity
sensitivity

Basis risk

The impact on earnings of relative changes in short-term interest rate benchmarks, for example between Bank rate and Sterling
Overnight Index Average (Sonia).

Earnings sensitivity

Swap spread risk

The impact on the market value of treasury investments arising from changes in the spread between bond yields and swap rates. Value at risk

Inflation risk

The impact on the market value of treasury investments arising from changes in inflation swap rates and published inflation
indices.

Value sensitivity

Currency risk

The impact on earnings and market value of treasury positions due to changes in exchange rates.

Value sensitivity / Value at risk

Product option risk

The impact from changes to hedging which may be required when customer behaviour deviates from expectations, principally
resulting from early repayment of fixed rate loans.

Value at risk / Economic value of equity
sensitivity

Structural interest
rate risk

The impact of market movements in interest rates, which affect the income arising from those balance sheet items that have
stable balances, an interest rate that is fixed, are non-interest bearing or insensitive to changes in market rates and have no
defined maturity date. This includes the asymmetric risk which arises in very low or negative interest rate scenarios, mainly due
to the different levels at which variable product rates can reach a minimum level.

Duration / Value at risk / Net interest income
sensitivity

Nationwide has a capital requirement for each of the above market risks. In addition, stress analysis is used to evaluate the impact of more extreme, but plausible events.

Value and earning sensitivities
Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the change in value of the net exposure to defined parallel and non-parallel shifts in interest rates. For example, a one basis point (0.01%) shift is measured using
PV01. This analysis is performed daily by currency. Earning sensitivity metrics are used to measure and quantify exposure to interest rate risks, including basis risk. These techniques assess the
impact on earnings when rate shocks are applied to the rates paid on liabilities and to the rates earned on assets.
Nationwide also measures interest rate risk through Net Interest Income (NII) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) measures, under a range of shock scenarios which include behavioural
assumptions for retail products as interest rates change. These measures are assessed based on the standard shocks prescribed, as well as against internally generated shock scenarios.
• NII sensitivities assess the impact to earnings in different interest rate shocks over a one-year period. Sensitivities are calculated based on a static balance sheet, where all assets and liabilities
maturing within the year are reinvested in like-for-like products. The sensitivity also includes the impact arising from off-balance sheet exposures.
• EVE sensitivities measure the change in value of interest rate sensitive items, both on and off-balance sheet, under a range of interest rate shocks. Sensitivities are calculated on a run-off balance
sheet basis.
Both NII and EVE sensitivities are measured regularly, with risk limits set against the various shocks.
Value at Risk (VaR)
VaR is a technique that estimates the maximum potential losses that could occur from risk positions because of future movements in market rates and prices, over a specified time horizon, to a
given level of statistical confidence. VaR is based on historic market behaviour and uses a series of recorded market rates and prices to derive plausible future scenarios. This considers interrelationships between different markets and rates.
The VaR model incorporates risk factors based on historic interest rate and currency movements using a ten-year historical data series. A two-week horizon and a 99% confidence level is used in
day-to-day VaR monitoring. VaR is used to monitor interest rate, swap spread, currency and product option risks and is not used to model income. Exposures against limits are reviewed daily by
management. Actual outcomes are monitored on an ongoing basis by management to test the validity of the assumptions and factors used in the VaR calculation.
Although VaR is a valuable risk measure, it needs to be viewed in the context of the following limitations which may mean that exposures could be higher than modelled:
• The use of a 99% confidence level, by definition, does not take account of changes in value that might occur beyond this level of confidence;
• VaR models often under-predict the likelihood of extreme events and over-predict the benefits of offsetting positions in those extreme events;
• The VaR model uses historical data to predict future events. Extreme market moves outside of those used to calibrate the model will deliver exceptions. In periods where volatility is increasing,
the model is likely to under-predict market risks and in periods where volatility is decreasing it is likely to over-predict market risks; and
• Historical data may not adequately predict circumstances arising from government interventions and stimulus packages, which increase the difficulty of evaluating risks.
The Society validates the VaR model on a monthly basis by back-testing the calculated VaR against a hypothetical profit and loss, which reflects the profit and loss that would have been realised if
positions were held constant over a two-week period. An exception is recognised where a loss over a ten working-day period exceeds the VaR calculated by the model. The number of exceptions
over a 12 month period is used to assess the performance of the VaR model, which in turn helps to decide whether it requires recalibration.

In addition, the model is subject to an annual review process to ensure it remains appropriate for risk reporting. The types of risks not captured in VaR include:
• Market liquidity risk – this has a limited impact because, whilst Nationwide requires an appropriate level of market liquidity to manage market risk, it does not have a high ongoing dependency
on liquidity for market risk purposes as it does not operate a trading book;
• Interest rate movements that can impact valuation adjustments, including credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments (CVA/DVA/FVA). These are not captured in the VaR or sensitivity
analysis but are negligible.
In addition, stressed VaR is used to estimate the potential loss arising from unfavourable market movements in a stressed environment. It is calculated in the same way as standard VaR, calibrated
with a 99% confidence level and on a two-week basis, but uses market data from a two-year period of significant financial stress.
Interest rate risk
Nationwide’s main market risk is interest rate risk. Market movements in interest rates affect the interest rate margin realised from lending and borrowing activities. To reduce the impact of such
movements, hedging activities are undertaken by Nationwide’s Treasury function. For example, interest rate risks generated by lending to and receiving deposits from customers are offset against
each other internally where possible. The remaining net exposure is managed using derivatives, within parameters set by ALCO. In addition to our primary lending and borrowing activities, income
volatility arising from certain rate insensitive products (including reserves and CCDS) are structurally hedged. Nationwide’s interest rate risk is measured using a combination of value-based
assessments and earnings sensitivity assessments.
The table below highlights Nationwide’s limited exposure to interest rate risk, shown against a range of value-based assessments. The risk exposure is calculated each day and summarised over the
financial year:

The interest rate sensitivities in the table above do not include retail product behavioural changes, which are captured by other measures.
During December 2021 Nationwide's GBP Libor contracts were transitioned to Sonia ahead of Libor cessation on 1 January 2022. The interest rate VaR metric during this period was heightened
because offsetting contracts were not always transitioned at the same time, leaving a temporary but significant Sonia Libor basis risk in the position.

Net Interest Income sensitivity (NII)
The sensitivities presented below measure the extent to which Nationwide’s pre-tax earnings are exposed to changes in interest rates over a one-year period based on instantaneous parallel rises
and falls in interest rates, with the shifts applied to the prevailing interest rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivities are prepared based on a static balance sheet, with all assets and liabilities maturing within the year replaced with like-for-like products, and changes in interest rates being fully
passed through to variable rate retail products, unless a 0% floor is reached when rates fall. No management actions are included in the sensitivities.
The purpose of these sensitivities is to assess Nationwide’s exposure to interest rate risk and therefore the sensitivities should not be considered as a guide to future earnings performance, with
actual future earnings influenced by the extent to which changes in interest rates are passed through to product pricing, the timing of maturing assets and liabilities and changes to the balance
sheet mix. In practice, earnings changes from actual interest rate movements will differ from those shown below because interest rate changes may not be passed through in full to those assets and
liabilities that do not have a contractual link to Bank rate.

The low levels of NII sensitivity reflect Nationwide’s prudent management of interest rate risk. The sensitivities also reflect that changes in rates are fully passed through in these scenarios, and
product margins are held static. The impact of take-up risk in the mortgage pipeline is included within the sensitivities, which contributes to the small negative sensitivities in the +25 and +100
basis point shifts.
Economic Value of Equity (EVE)
Nationwide also measures interest rate risk through EVE sensitivity which identifies the change in value of interest rate sensitive items, both on and off-balance sheet, under a range of interest rate
shocks prescribed by the PRA. This measure includes behavioural assumptions using a run-off balance sheet basis. EVE is managed against internal and regulatory risk limits and is monitored by
ALCO.
Further details on EVE can be found in the Group’s annual Pillar 3 Disclosure for 2023 at nationwide.co.uk

Basis risk
Basis risk arises where variable rate assets and liabilities re-price with reference to differing short-term interest rate benchmarks. The primary interest rates that Nationwide is exposed to are the
Bank rate and Sonia. If the difference between these interest rates changes over time, this may impact earnings.
Assets and liabilities are offset when their reference rate, or ‘basis’ type, is matched. Exposure to the net mismatch is mitigated, where required, by transacting basis swaps to ensure Nationwide
remains within internally agreed risk limits.
Swap spread risk
A liquidity portfolio is held to manage Nationwide’s liquidity risk. The assets in this portfolio are predominantly fixed rate sovereign debt securities. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the interest
rate risk associated with these assets. However, there remains a residual risk associated with the possible movement in the spread between sovereign debt yields and swap rates. This swap spread
risk reflects the fact that the market value of the liquidity portfolio assets can change due to movements in bond yields and the swaps due to movements in swap rates. In economic terms, this risk is
only realised if a bond is sold and the swap is cancelled ahead of maturity.
Swap spread risk is monitored using a historical VaR metric and the risk is controlled via internal limits linked to capital requirements. Exposures are monitored daily and are reported monthly to
ALCO.
Inflation risk
The risk arising from Nationwide’s inflation-linked investments are mitigated through the use of inflation swaps and the residual exposure monitored through IE01 metrics, which measure the
change in present value of future cashflows from a one basis point parallel shift in inflation swap rates. Inflation risk is captured within our swap spread VaR risk measurement.
Currency risk
Currency exposure is managed through natural offsetting on the balance sheet, with derivatives used to maintain the net exposures within limits. ALCO sets and monitors limits on the net currency
exposure. The table below sets out the limited extent of the residual exposure to currency risk:

Product option risk
Market risk also arises when customers exercise options contained within fixed rate products which can require changes to hedging. The key product risks are prepayment risk (early redemption or
under- or over-payment of fixed rate mortgages), access risk (early withdrawal of fixed rate savings), and take-up risk (higher or lower completions of fixed rate mortgages than expected). These risk
exposures are quantified under a range of stress scenarios using models that predict customer behaviour in response to changes in interest rates. The potential impacts are then closely monitored.

Structural interest rate risk
Nationwide has structural hedging programmes in place to stabilise earnings as interest rates change. Structural hedging is transacted to manage the interest rate risk from balance sheet items
that have stable balances, an interest rate that is fixed or non-interest bearing and have no defined maturity date. The most material hedging programmes are in place to manage liabilities,
including reserves and customer deposits.
Without hedging, the returns earned on these balances are subject to the volatility of short-term interest rates. The structural hedging programme smooths the volatility in net interest margin
arising from changes in interest rates. The structural hedges convert the return, through a rolling hedge, into a more stable medium-term return.
Structural hedging is managed to a target duration. A two-and-a-half-year target duration is applied to eligible reserves and customer deposit balances. Nationwide’s approach to financial planning
assumes that structural hedging will be maintained in line with the target duration, with risk limits in place to mitigate deviation from the target duration.
In addition to the structural hedging programmes, Nationwide also undertakes other balance sheet hedging to mitigate the asymmetric risk which arises in very low or negative interest rate
scenarios, mainly due to the different levels at which variable product rates can reach a minimum floor level.
Outlook
Nationwide will continue to have a limited appetite for market risk, which will only be taken if essential to core business activities and provides stability of earnings, minimises costs or enables
operational efficiency.

Pension risk

Risk report (continued)

Pension risk
Summary
Pension risk is defined as the risk that the value of the pension schemes’ assets will be insufficient to meet the estimated liabilities, creating a pension deficit. Pension risk could negatively impact
Nationwide’s capital position and might result in increased cash funding obligations to the pension schemes.
Nationwide has funding obligations to a number of defined benefit pension schemes, the largest of which is the Nationwide Pension Fund (the Fund) which represents over 99% of the Society’s
pension obligations. The Fund has approximately 29,000 participants (Fund members), the majority of whom are deferred members (former and current employee members, not yet retired). The
Fund closed to new entrants in 2007 and closed to future accrual on 31 March 2021. Further detail is set out below and in note 30 to the financial statements.
In accordance with UK legislation, the assets of the Fund are held in a legally separate trust from Nationwide’s assets and are administered by a board of trustees (the Trustee) which has fiduciary
responsibilities to Fund members.
Nationwide has a specialist pension risk management team responsible for regular analysis, insight and monitoring, which help monitor financial risk to the Group from the Fund. This includes risk
appetite articulation and regular reporting to governance committees. The team maintains effective engagement with the Trustee in order to manage the long-term impact on Nationwide’s capital
and financial position. This is supported by Nationwide’s representation at the Trustee’s Investment and Funding Committee and investment working groups, and the sharing of management
information between Nationwide and the Trustee in order to consider specific risk management initiatives.
Pension risk is embedded into Nationwide’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and stress testing processes. Nationwide monitors the potential capital deterioration from the retirement
benefit position that might occur in a 1-in-200-year stress test. Nationwide considers all pension regulation and legislation change which may impact Nationwide’s obligations to the Fund.
Risk factors
Volatility in investment returns from the assets and the value of the liabilities both affect the Fund’s net deficit or surplus position. The key risk factors which impact this position are set out below.
These factors can have a positive or negative effect on the position.
Asset performance
The Fund’s liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality bond yields. This creates a risk that the Fund’s assets perform worse than those bond yields, resulting in
the Fund’s net position being volatile or worsening.
The Fund holds a proportion of return-seeking assets, including private equity, infrastructure, property and credit investments. Return-seeking assets are expected to outperform liabilities in the
long-term, but they are riskier and volatile in the short to medium-term. Investments in return-seeking assets are monitored by both the Trustee and Nationwide to ensure they remain appropriate
given the Fund’s long-term objectives. Further details are set out in note 30 to the financial statements.
Liabilities
There is a risk that the Fund’s liabilities increase to a level which is not supported by asset performance, whether through discount rate changes, increases in long-term inflation expectations, or
increases in the life expectancy (longevity) of Fund members.

Actuarial assumptions
There is a risk that a change in the methodology used to derive key actuarial assumptions (for example, the discount rate or longevity assumptions) results in a step change in the assessment of the
liabilities and therefore in the net surplus or deficit, potentially impacting Nationwide's capital and/or deficit funding requirements. The ultimate cost of providing pension benefits over the life of the
Fund will depend on actual future events, rather than assumptions made.
Changes in the year
As the Fund is closed to future accrual, there were no employer contributions made in respect of future benefit accrual during the year. There were also no employer deficit contributions into the
Fund for the year ended 4 April 2023 and none are scheduled for the year ending 4 April 2024.
During the year, Nationwide and the Trustee agreed to a new Schedule of Contributions following the finalisation of the Fund’s 31 March 2022 Triennial Valuation. As the Triennial Valuation
indicated a funding surplus, a recovery plan requiring employer deficit contributions was not needed. The effective date of the Fund’s next Triennial Valuation is 31 March 2025. Employer deficit
contributions of £1 million were made in respect of the Group’s defined benefit scheme in its Nationwide (Isle of Man) Limited subsidiary.
The retirement benefit position on the balance sheet as at 4 April 2023 is a £946 million (2022: £1,008 million) surplus within assets as set out below:

The movement in the retirement benefit obligation is driven by a decrease in asset values, which was partially offset by a decrease in pension liabilities. The significant increase in interest rates over
the period has had a broadly neutral impact, with a reduction in liabilities, due to higher discount rates, being broadly offset by the changes in the value of scheme assets. Actual inflation over the
year being higher than expected increased pension liabilities; this was partially offset by updates to the demographic assumptions.
The actuarial remeasurement quantifies the impact on the net obligation from updating financial assumptions (e.g. discount rate and long-term inflation), demographic assumptions (e.g. longevity),
and the return on the Fund’s assets being greater or less than expected. Further details can be found in note 30 to the financial statements.
Outlook
Over the long term, the Trustee intends to reduce further the Fund’s risk factors, and Nationwide actively engages with the Trustee to ensure broad alignment on investment objectives and
implementation. Potential risk management initiatives include, but are not limited to, adjusting the asset allocation (reducing the allocation to return-seeking assets and increasing the allocation to
liability matching assets), longevity hedging and implementing derivative and other hedging strategies.

Business risk

Risk report (continued)

Business risk
Summary
Nationwide defines business risk as the risk that achievable volumes or margins decline relative to the cost base, affecting the sustainability of the business and its ability to deliver the strategy, due
to macro-economic, geopolitical, industry, competitor, regulatory or other external events. This risk is actively managed to ensure the Society provides value to, and can meet the needs of, current
and future members, with a focus on long-term sustainability rather than short-term benefit. Nationwide ensures that it can generate sustainable profits by focusing on recurrent sources of income
that provide value commensurate with risk appetite. This risk is monitored as part of ongoing business performance reporting to, and through regular discussion of business model risks by, senior
management and the Board.
Nationwide’s business model is reliant on generating net interest margin – primarily the difference between the interest rates paid to savers and those received from mortgage holders. During 2022
and continuing into 2023, high inflation has led to a monetary policy response by the Bank of England, with Bank rate rising from 0.1% to 4.5% in May 2023. Whilst ongoing competition from
incumbent banks and digitally-focused new entrants remained strong, rising interest rates have enabled the Society to ease some pressure on margin. However, a rise in the cost of living has
influenced consumer behaviour and inflationary growth continues to impact on the cost of operating the Society. To mitigate the impact on the Society’s financial performance there is an ongoing
focus on operational excellence which promotes enhanced efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, continual reviews of member propositions maintain the Society’s competitive position in the core
mortgage and savings markets in which it operates.
Managing business risk
Business risks are identified as part of the Society’s strategy and financial planning processes and through regular horizon scanning exercises. This activity highlights potential areas of strategic
development and areas requiring further assessment through a range of sensitivities to the Society’s Financial Plan. Ongoing monitoring ensures the strategy and associated execution plans
continue to evolve to address business model risks by considering changes in the external environment, including technology innovation, consumer behaviour, regulation, and market conditions.
These risks are assessed against Board Risk Appetite to ensure the right balance between distributing value through propositions, investing in the business, and maintaining financial strength.
Business risk is managed and mitigated through a range of measures which include:
• Financial forecasting – As part of the financial planning process, income and costs are forecast over a five-year period with an updated forecast reviewed regularly by management, taking into
consideration the key risks and sensitivities.
• Monitoring of financial and business performance – The various components of financial performance are monitored monthly against internal forecasts and key indicators across a variety of
committees and fora, which consider potential risks and possible mitigating actions. In addition, business areas monitor the demand for products and services to ensure we continue to provide
propositions that customers want and need, and which provide value to the Society.
• Stress testing and sensitivity analysis – Business risk is regularly stress tested as part of internal management reporting such as via upside and downside scenarios to the Financial Plan, the
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, and reverse stress tests. In addition, the Prudential Regulatory Authority’s Annual Concurrent Stress testing scenarios provide a test of the
business model and the risks it is exposed to. As an output from these activities, potential actions are identified that can be taken if risks crystallise. To effectively manage more extreme events a
Recovery Plan is maintained, in line with regulatory guidance, that contains a range of indicators which are regularly monitored, and a list of strategic actions that could be taken, if necessary, to
protect the Society in the event of severe stress.
Outlook
Business risks are closely linked to the top and emerging risks outlined in the Risk overview (on pages 65 to 66). The Bank of England expects economic output to be broadly flat in the first half of
2023 and rise modestly thereafter. Nonetheless, sustained pressure from an increased cost of living continues to impact both customers and the Society’s business risk, as consumers adapt to
macro-economic factors influencing the UK economy. Ongoing elevated geopolitical tensions create additional uncertainty and may exacerbate business risk. Business risk will be impacted by
competition within the mortgage and savings markets, which is expected to remain strong. To mitigate the business risk associated with these uncertain macro-economic and market conditions it
is important the Society delivers its key strategic priorities.

Operational and conduct risk

Risk report (continued)

Operational and conduct risk
Summary
Operational and conduct risk is defined as the risk of impacts resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, conduct and compliance management, people and systems, or from external
events. These are managed through proportionate controls designed to identify and prevent failures that could affect customers, colleagues or the Society. How the control environment operates is
covered in more detail in the Managing risk section on pages 139 to 142.
Nationwide recognises the need for continuous improvement in the understanding of the operational and conduct risks it is exposed to and the associated control environment it relies on to
mitigate these risks. A programme has been completed to further develop the organisation’s understanding of the most prominent risks and controls within key customer-facing processes. In
addition, there is an ongoing programme of work to support the management of economic crime obligations. Taken together, this work has enabled Nationwide to refine and develop its approach
to the identification and management of risk, and to build understanding of how learnings can be applied more broadly across other key processes. It will also help to improve customer experiences
and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes and controls operated, and improve ongoing regulatory compliance. It is critical Nationwide remains safe and secure and does the right
thing for its customers, with a risk and control culture embedded within the broader Society culture.
Over the last year, there has been continued focus on achieving the high standards expected by customers and regulators in the management of operational and conduct risk across the key areas
detailed below.
Information and technology management
Operational resilience remains key to the Society’s strategy and the regulatory environment. Customers, understandably, expect services to be available when they want to use them, with a demand
for an ‘always on’ capability. Focus remains on keeping services resilient and available through ongoing investment in IT infrastructure. Investment has been prioritised in upgrading legacy
infrastructure, so services are delivered using the latest technology and also in retaining the necessary ongoing support from specialist third party IT suppliers. A significant volume of critical
infrastructure upgrades have been completed in the year to meet customer needs and adapt to the increased demand for online services.
Resilience remains a significant area of regulatory focus, with financial services providers expected to have a thorough understanding of the impacts of service disruptions on their customers and to
reduce these impacts over time. This includes identifying, understanding and continually assessing the Important Business Services (IBS), defining acceptable levels of disruption to these services
and ensuring these are not exceeded. Nationwide’s catalogue of impact tolerances, which define the maximum tolerable level of disruption to important services, are subject to ongoing validation
against regulatory and customer expectations. The Society continues to test and exercise its incident management and disaster recovery responses to known threats by running scenarios, live
incident simulations and structured recovery walkthroughs. In response to recent regulatory policies, the detailed mapping of the IBS to identify vulnerabilities continues to develop.
System change carries risk and whilst significant effort has been made to mitigate this risk, including improving the stability of critical payment infrastructure, on occasions customers have
experienced disruption to services. There is further work to do in this area to ensure the potential for any future disruption is minimised.
Data
Nationwide is committed to protecting the personal data under its control. To ensure this is achieved, three key control frameworks have been implemented which span data privacy, governance
and security. Investment in data architecture and technology continues, allowing strategic solutions to be implemented and enabling the Society to store, manage and protect personal data more
effectively in an evolving digital environment. Progress continues to be made on data quality and data processes to improve customer experience and reduce the likelihood of a data breach.

Operational and conduct risk (continued)

The rapid growth of digitisation and demand for a better customer experience leads to greater volumes of data to control and more complex challenges in ensuring that data is used ethically and
appropriately, including in relation to emerging developments in artificial intelligence. This requires an evolving set of skills both to operate and maintain systems and ensure a rigorous focus on
customer outcomes and vulnerability. The data governance framework, and the implementation of a new data governance system in the latter half of 2022 have improved confidence in, and
understanding of, the business data underpinning key business decisions.
Cyber security
As IT systems are managed and new technology is delivered for the future, the impact a successful cyber-attack could have on a customer’s ability to manage their finances remains a critical area of
focus. Significant effort is put into cyber risk management capabilities, with ongoing investment in the avoidance, detection and prevention of attacks and continued testing of responses should an
attack be successful.
Cloud services continue to be adopted and we continue to invest in the associated technologies and working practices to ensure these new services are secure. When adopting these services,
Nationwide ensures they are introduced with an acceptable level of risk through the operation of existing, and where required, new security controls. To manage the wider supply chain risk, third
parties are required to follow a risk assessment process with proportionate security measures put in place which are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Applying lessons learned is critical to managing cyber risk effectively. Testing Nationwide’s multi-layered approach to the protection of information is undertaken on an ongoing basis, including the
use of techniques and procedures practiced by individuals and organisations that attempt to conduct malicious activity. This provides the Society with confidence in its controls and allows a better
understanding of how to prevent future attacks, ensuring technical controls are constantly developed, resource is repositioned, and funding is allocated appropriately.
Nationwide continues to work closely with the National Cyber Security Centre, other government bodies and peers in financial services and other industries. This enables Nationwide to remain
informed about both the potential threats and responses, while sharing best practice in combatting cyber-crime. Continued collaboration with these bodies ensures an effective security stance
against current threats, as well as emergent threats in a dynamic cyber landscape, is maintained.
Supply chain
Nationwide continues to use a network of third parties to provide both core and non-core services, such as IT infrastructure and support, and customer-facing services. When outsourcing activities
to third parties, Nationwide retains responsibility for all services and the associated risks.
Regulatory expectations continue to evolve in relation to third party risk management. The requirements of Supervisory Statement SS2/21, which came in force on 31 March 2022, continue to be
embedded. This includes proportionate risk management according to the criticality of the third party service and having controls to support the resilience of the Society, such as increased focus on
exit management, regular ongoing performance monitoring and robust contractual provisions.
The Bank of England has published a discussion paper to gather industry views on the potential ways to manage the systemic risks posed by critical third parties. This recognises the increasing
reliance within financial services on certain third parties, and how this impacts the supervisory authorities’ objectives of protecting the UK’s financial stability, market integrity and consumer
protection. Further communication around next steps is expected in 2023.

Colleagues / employment practices
Our people are fundamental to the success of Nationwide, and attracting and retaining people with in-demand skills and capabilities continues to be a key area of focus. A highly competitive
external labour market, upward pressure on pay in light of significant increases in inflation, and the rise of flexible working across the industry, present both opportunities and risks to the attraction
and retention of diverse talent. Focus remains on improving diversity across all levels of the workforce, ensuring it is a place where colleagues know they can be themselves and thrive at work.
The cost of living pressures impact not only customers, but also colleagues. The organisation is committed to supporting them with a wide range of resources put in place to help with financial and
emotional wellbeing, which has included making a cost of living payment to eligible colleagues in 2022. The situation continues to be monitored closely to ensure colleagues remain supported
through these challenging times.
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way of working, with many colleagues working from home over the last three years. As hybrid working becomes the norm across many businesses, there is
still an important role for office workspace as a means of enabling people to come together to share ideas and solutions. The evolving ways of working continue to have an impact on a number of the
Society’s top people risks, such as employee sentiment, managing performance and productivity. These remain key considerations as the Society continues to develop its hybrid working approach.
Nationwide’s refreshed strategy will continue to target increasing the skills and capabilities of the workforce, creating a more efficient organisation and enabling the Society to meet the changing
needs of its customers, whilst ensuring all aspects of diversity remain front of mind. As we develop the organisation for the future, we will manage the impacts of change carefully, and our wellbeing
and inclusion strategy will ensure focus on supporting colleagues through transformation and organisational change.
Economic crime
Nationwide, as a UK-wide financial services firm, is exposed to economic crime risks across all its business lines. Criminal activity to which Nationwide is exposed includes money laundering,
terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions and tax evasion, and fraud, both external and internal. The Society may be adversely affected if its customers, employees or third parties engage
in criminal activity, or if the Society’s products or services are used to facilitate economic crime. Furthermore, the Society may incur significant remediation costs to rectify issues, reimburse losses
incurred by customers, and address regulatory censure and penalties. Management's consideration of such matters and any associated contingent liabilities or provisions is discussed further in
notes 27 and 29 to the financial statements. The Society takes its obligations and responsibilities to reduce the risk of it being used to further economic crime seriously. Accordingly, it operates a
framework of controls, which is supported by a suite of policies, control standards and procedures.
The management of economic crime remains a key area of focus, with a combination of evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and changing criminal methods shaping the nature of the
threats it faces. The Economic Crime Risk Committee, chaired by the Director of Retail Products, is the core governance committee for economic crime. It oversees economic crime risk
management, operational performance, and transformation matters, including decision making, and escalates matters to the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.
Cost of living and customers in financial difficulty
The increased cost of living and more volatile interest rate environment pose challenges for the management of conduct risk as more customers are expected to face financial difficulty. In this
context, Nationwide remains committed to ensuring good customer outcomes and to meeting the expectations of regulators in relation to the fair treatment of customers. In addition to ensuring
that colleagues are made available to effectively support any customers experiencing financial difficulty, Nationwide has taken a series of steps to support those customers who may be facing cost of
living challenges, including a freephone support helpline, cost of living training for front line advisors and financial health checks for customers. Supporting vulnerable customers remains a priority
for the Society. Nationwide’s strategic focus is on embedding consideration of the additional needs of vulnerable consumers into its culture, making it the responsibility of all colleagues whose work
impacts its customers.

Good customer outcomes and the Consumer Duty
Nationwide is committed to ensuring the right customer outcomes are achieved in all circumstances. The Society will continue to provide safe, secure and fair value products and services which
meet the needs of customers, will continue to provide clear communications which enable customers to make the right decisions at the right time, and will continue to provide effective support to
allow customers to realise the benefits of their products.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has finalised its Consumer Duty which, when implemented in July 2023, will require a higher standard of consumer care beyond the current set of principles
and rules. Firms must be more proactive in the delivery of fair outcomes, and there will be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny of firms’ approaches to delivering such outcomes. In this context,
there is a heightened risk across the financial services industry of regulatory sanctions arising from failures in relation to the fair treatment of customers. A programme of work is ongoing across the
Society to ensure full preparedness for the Consumer Duty prior to when it becomes effective.
Other key regulatory developments
There continues to be a high volume of complex regulatory change impacting the financial services industry, and Nationwide will respond to these changes while actively engaging with its
regulators.
In December 2022 the Government published its ‘Edinburgh Reforms’, a package of measures designed to update a wide range of financial services regulation. Where appropriate, Nationwide is
engaging with these proposals. Nationwide is also actively engaged in the wider ongoing development of the UK’s Future Regulatory Framework, which will determine how regulatory rulemaking
powers will be distributed following the UK’s exit from the European Union, and the mechanisms for improving accountability and scrutiny of those exercising those powers.
As expected, the PRA has published a consultation paper on the implementation of the remaining elements of the Basel III framework, with implementation currently scheduled to begin in 2025
(delayed from 2023). Further detail on the expected impact for Nationwide is provided in the ‘Capital risk’ section.
In line with Supervisory Statement SS3/19 ‘Enhancing banks’ and insurers’ approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change’, the PRA is now actively supervising firms’ approaches to
managing climate-related financial risks. Detail on Nationwide’s progress in embedding climate-related risk to meet SS3/19 requirements can be found in the ‘Climate-related Financial Disclosures
overview’ section and in the standalone ‘Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2023’.

increased volume of events has been driven by Authorised Push Payment scams. The increase in value is the result of payment providers now bearing a greater proportion of the total losses
incurred, and additional provisions set aside relating to fraud-related remediation projects. The Society continues to monitor and respond, including working closely with regulatory bodies and the
Society’s banking peers, to collaboratively drive improvements in fraud prevention, education and reporting of fair outcomes.
The value of losses against the ‘Clients, products and business practices’ category decreased in 2023, primarily driven by a reduction of PPI-related losses.
Whilst the volume of losses against the ‘Execution, delivery and process management’ category have decreased this year, the total value of these losses has increased. These losses are largely
attributed to key remediation projects.

Operational and conduct risk (continued)
and Model risk

Outlook
Nationwide’s operational and conduct risk outlook is impacted by the environment it operates in and its strategy. The drivers of operational and conduct risk are expected to remain broadly
consistent, with the main themes being:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

the impact of the rising cost of living on customers;
the continuing evolution of economic crime, through fraud, scams and other criminal activity;
the challenging labour market impacting the ability to attract and retain people with in-demand skills and capabilities;
the delivery of organisational change;
the volume and complexity of regulatory developments impacting the financial services industry;
IT resilience and the continued increase in the sophistication of cyber security threats and external fraud;
the change activity from de-risking and simplification of Nationwide’s IT infrastructure;
continued reliance on strategic third party partners, including increased adoption of cloud-based solutions; and
the understanding and management of the operational risks associated with climate change.

The Society continues to invest to maintain and develop appropriate controls in all these areas to ensure residual risk exposures are managed within appetite.

Model risk
Summary
Model risk is the risk of an adverse outcome as a direct result of weaknesses or failures in the development, implementation or use of a model. A model is defined as ‘a simplification of a business
system using assumptions and mathematical concepts to help describe, predict or forecast’. There is an inherent risk associated with models because, by their very nature, they are imperfect and
incomplete representations that rely on assumptions and theoretical methodologies and use historic data which may not represent future outcomes.
Models are relied on to support a broad range of business and risk management activities across the Society. Key examples include the use of model outputs in the credit approval process, capital
and liquidity assessments, stress testing, loss provisioning, financial planning and pricing strategies. Models which apply advanced machine learning techniques to other risk types such as climate
change and economic crime are also used. Model errors can arise when models are implemented incorrectly or misused, for instance when applied to uses that they were not designed for, or where
there is a failure to update key assumptions when required. Model errors and uncertainty are the primary sources of model risk which, if crystallised, could result in poor lending decisions, holding
inappropriate levels of capital, liquidity or provisions or incurring a financial loss.
Model risk remains heightened due to inflationary and cost of living pressures, interest rate rises and market volatility experienced during 2022/23. These factors have adversely impacted the
performance of some models and placed greater reliance on the use of model adjustments to capture the risks and uncertainty arising from the effects of the economic environment.
Managing model risk
Model risk is managed at an enterprise level through the Model Risk Framework and within a defined risk appetite set by the Board. The framework prescribes Society-wide requirements including
roles and responsibilities, governance, independent oversight, risk appetite, monitoring and independent assurance.

Model risk (continued)

The framework is supported by model risk policies and standards covering documentation, development, implementation, validation, change processes and monitoring. This ensures that models are
of sufficient quality to support effective business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.
Responsibility for oversight of model risk is delegated from the Executive Risk Committee to the Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC). MROC assesses whether models are fit for purpose and
monitors model risk exposure on a Society-wide aggregated basis.
Model risk appetite is expressed through assessments of the most material models. This considers the percentage of models that have been independently assessed as meeting internal standards.
Issues are escalated to the Executive Risk Committee when necessary, or where a breach of risk appetite has occurred.
The change in economic conditions experienced during 2022/23 means that historical data on which some models were built and calibrated has become less representative of the prevailing
environment, increasing the need for model adjustments. As the economic uncertainty continues, model adjustments will remain a key area of focus within the Group’s model risk management
process. An enhanced framework for model adjustments has been implemented to ensure they are robustly governed, applied and monitored, with a particular focus on segments and exposures
that are more susceptible to interest rates and inflation.
Work is underway to deliver new capital models that comply with the IRB Roadmap regulations which came into effect on 1 January 2022. Delivery of these new models is in line with the PRA
timetable. Temporary adjustments are currently made to risk weighted assets, ensuring the Group’s capital requirements reflect the expected outcomes of the revised IRB rules. Further information
on capital impacts is detailed in the Capital risk section on page 194.
Responsibilities under the three lines of defence
Each model is required to have a model owner who is responsible for ensuring that their model complies with the requirements of the framework. Responsibility for approving the use of material
models resides with first line risk committees, such as the Asset and Liability Committee and Credit Committee. The role of these committees is to review, approve and monitor all material aspects
of the models within their remit.
The second line oversight of model risk is performed by the Model Risk Oversight function which provides independent validation, verification, setting of model standards, reporting of the model risk
profile and maintenance of the Society’s model inventory. The scope of independent validation includes a review of model inputs, design and outputs. This is further broken down into detailed
dimensions covering areas such as data, methodology, performance, use and documentation. The outcome of the validation is a report which includes a model risk score, key risks, model
capabilities, conditions for use, limitations, validation findings and a recommendation as to whether models are fit for purpose.
While all material models are reviewed and re-approved for continued use each year, the validation frequency and level of challenge applied by Model Risk Oversight is tailored to the materiality and
complexity of each model. Once validated and implemented, models are subject to regular monitoring. A central model inventory is used to maintain data on models and validation issues raised by
Model Risk Oversight are tracked through to resolution. An annual model universe assessment is used to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the model inventory.
Nationwide’s Internal Audit function, the third line of defence, considers model risk to be an area of focus and the Model Risk Framework is subject to review through a cyclical programme of audits
that assess the appropriateness of its design and overall effectiveness, and may assess how specific models used in Nationwide comply with it. The findings of the audit reviews are reported to Audit
Committee, senior management and appropriate stakeholders.

Developments in the year
In June 2022, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) published a consultation paper, ‘Model Risk Management Principles for banks’. The proposals contain five principles and expectations which
the PRA considers key to establishing an effective model risk management framework. Work is underway to respond effectively to the resulting Supervisory Statement which is expected to be
published in 2023 with an implementation date of 12 months later.
In November 2022, the PRA published a consultation paper ‘Implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards’ setting out proposed rule changes and expectations for implementation of the relevant Basel
III standards. The changes are designed to improve the measurement of risk in capital models, standardise approaches and reduce excessive variability in the calculation of risk weights. The key
amendments include revisions to the standardised approaches for credit and operational risks and a risk weight output floor for Pillar 1 RWAs. The Society conducted a detailed review of the
proposed regulation and engaged with UK Finance to provide an industry level response. Further information on capital impacts are detailed in the Capital risk section on page 194.
Over the past year models used to quantify key risks have been enhanced and improvements in the management of model risk continue to be made, including:
• Continuing the evolution of the scope of model risk reporting and education provided to the Board and senior management, thereby supporting better-informed decision making and ensuring
that management remain aware of developments in model risk, model limitations, uncertainty and risks emerging from changes in the external and internal environment; and
• Progressing the development, validation and governance of capital models to comply with the regulatory IRB roadmap.
Outlook
Significant levels of regulatory change continue to be a key factor driving model development, validation and risk management activity. In common with the rest of the industry, changes required to
capital models following new regulations will create a temporary increase in the risk relating to these models during the period of transition. The prolonged use and reliance on model adjustments
results in increased governance, complexity and compliance risks. Development of the retail capital models to meet new IRB Roadmap regulatory requirements continues as we engage with the
PRA regarding approval and implementation timings.
The model risk management principles proposed by the PRA in their June 2022 consultation paper are expected to create a significant step change in the Society’s scope of model risk management
activity going forward. Arrangements are underway to implement the final proposals when published in a Supervisory Statement.
Economic uncertainty in the form of high inflation and higher interest rates introduces risks of changing member behaviours and some models operating outside of their development data
boundaries. This is likely to affect models that were designed and implemented in a low inflation and low interest environment. In response to this, Nationwide continues to monitor the external
situation, considering how representative it is of current and future risk environments; it has also adapted affordability models and is undertaking stressed inflationary scenario analysis.

Conclusions relating to going concern
The directors have voluntarily complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) and Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(3)(a) of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and provided a viability and
going concern statement, required for companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of
the directors’ assessment of the Group and Society’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

We obtained management’s going concern assessment for the Group, including forecasts for the going concern period covering 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements
by the Board, and compared historical budgeted financial information with actual results to form a view of the reliability of the forecasting process.
We understood and evaluated the reasonableness of these forecasts, which included using EY financial modelling specialists to help assess the assumptions used to develop forecasted results
using relevant peer and sector comparatives, to challenge the reasonableness of the Bank rate assumptions and resultant impact on net interest margin, operating costs, customer deposit
growth and to assess the refinancing risk of wholesale funding maturing in the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements by the Board.
We used economic specialists in assessing the macroeconomic assumptions in the forecast through benchmarking to institutional and HM Treasury consensus forecasts and Bank of England
fan charts.
We reviewed the results of adverse scenarios modelled by management to incorporate unexpected changes to forecasted liquidity and capital positions of the Group, as well as its reverse stress
testing exercise, to identify whether they indicated significant issues that might impact the Group’s or Society’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We also understood the directors’ considerations of the current uncertain geopolitical and economic outlook and climate change, including both financial risks and impacts on operational
resilience.
We read and evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures included in the Annual Report in relation to going concern and considered whether there were other events subsequent to the balance
sheet date which could have a bearing on the going concern conclusion.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and
Society’s ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months from the date the financial statements are approved for issue.
In relation to the Group and Society’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’
statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s or Society’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Based on the work we performed, we were satisfied that IFRS 9 expected credit losses were reasonably stated.
• Our stand-back assessment of the overall provision balance, in light of the current economic environment, through peer benchmarking and analysis of key indicators, such as coverage ratios, did
not indicate the provision recorded as at year end was unreasonable
• Independent model testing showed that IFRS 9 ECL models performed as expected with some immaterial differences and were aligned to the requirements of the standard, and that the external
data, internal data and assumption data feeding into the IFRS 9 ECL models are complete and accurate.
• Economic assumptions and probability weightings assigned to the multiple economic scenarios used within the models were concluded to be reasonable.
• Staging criteria were appropriate and the results of staging reperformance indicated their application was complete and accurate.
• Independent replication of PMA calculations confirmed they had been accurately recorded, and we were satisfied that they were complete and appropriate.
• Individual provisions recorded for the stage 3 commercial portfolio were in line with the industry-specific risks highlighted by our EY Real Estate specialists.

Key audit matter
Our response to the key audit matter
Intangible assets: £862 million (2022: £913 million)

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls over the Group’s asset capitalisation,
impairment, and amortisation processes.

The Group capitalises significant software and IT costs which are subsequently amortised
over their useful economic lives. Management undertakes bi-annual impairment assessments We assessed the appropriateness of capitalised costs for a sample of asset additions during the year,
including both externally and internally generated costs, and assets in use as well as work in progress.

impairment, recalculated impairment charges independently, and challenged the completeness of
impairments recorded.
We corroborated the reasonableness of useful economic lives by performing a stand back analysis to
the Group’s broader IT strategy, understanding pipeline projects and whether current assets would be
replaced and/or become obsolete in the future.
We involved EY business valuation modelling specialists to assess the assumptions used by the Society
in the prospective financial information and forecasts used for their CGU impairment assessment. We
considered whether the impacts of future plans were sufficiently reflected in the forecast used,
including changes to the technology strategy, likely future use of assets, impact of commitments
including climate-related commitments made by the Society, and assessment of the impact of
geopolitical tensions and cost of living pressures.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We are satisfied that the Society’s accounting policies and their application for capitalisation of new software assets and determination of related impairments are in compliance with the accounting
standards, IAS 38 and IAS 36, and we concluded that newly capitalised assets, impairments and amortisation in the current period are materially appropriate.

Risk of fraud in revenue recognition relating to effective interest rate (“EIR”) accounting]
Group and Society: Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 100); Accounting policies (page 240); and note 3 of the consolidated financial statements (page 254)
Key audit matter
Our response to the key audit matter
EIR adjustment to loans and advances: £58 million (2022: £85 million)
Management judgement is required in initially recognising financial instruments under the
EIR method, and assumptions made by management will also impact subsequent
amortisation of EIR adjustments. This leads to a heightened risk that management override
of controls could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements.

We understood and tested the design and effectiveness of the Group’s controls over automated
revenue recognition, including key reconciliations and processes to ensure complete and accurate
capture of fees, interest charges, customer payments and balances, but followed a substantive
approach to testing the EIR models and related balances.
We tested the data extracted from systems to be used in the EIR models, including historical data used
to analyse customer behaviours.

We assessed two elements of the EIR calculation as most critical and requiring increased
We reviewed the appropriateness of the accounting policy and the types of fees and expenses being
audit focus:
• The period over which to defer upfront fees and costs, which is determined by reference deferred and amortised. For those fees and expenses that were deferred, we assessed the
reasonableness of the period over which they were being amortised by assessing the behavioural loan

• The extent to which early redemption charges (“ERCs”) and variable interest expected lives with reference to historical behaviour and challenging the basis on which assumptions have been
made as to future customer behaviours, including additional considerations related to the current, and
to be collected in the future should be recognised as revenue/assets now.
forward-looking, economic environment, in particular the outlook for future interest rates.
We involved EY specialists in reviewing the functionality of the model, ensuring the consistency of the
calculations with the accounting policy. We also involved EY specialists in reviewing the code used to
extract historical data from the mortgage systems, to verify that the data used in the EIR models is
complete and accurate.
We benchmarked key assumptions used within the EIR calculation to equivalent assumptions made by
peers and performed sensitivity analyses over key assumptions and judgements. We extended our
analysis to reflect increased uncertainty and potential irregularities in purchase and switching activity
attributable to changes in Bank rate and the inflationary environment.
We also reviewed the accuracy of the amortisation model, tested its inputs, and recalculated a sample
of the amortisation profiles used to amortise the fees and expenses.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
We concluded that the fees and costs being deferred are reasonable and complete; the average lives used in the EIR model are reasonable; the extent of ERC fees recognised upfront is reasonable;
and the data populating the EIR model is complete and accurate. We concluded that the resulting EIR adjustments made to revenue fall within our independent range of outcomes, and were
materially in compliance with the requirements of IFRS 9.

specialists considered whether there was a material impact on the valuation of illiquid investments
which do not have readily determinable market value.
We performed sectoral and geographical analysis to assess the potential impact of climate change risk
and geopolitical tensions on the illiquid assets to inform our sampling of the assets during the testing
of the valuation of the illiquid assets.
We assessed whether the pension scheme has adequate funding and liquidity to cover the mark to
market volatility leading to collateral calls from the Liability Driven Investment held by the pension
scheme.
We considered the appropriateness of the Society’s recognition of a pension asset in accordance with
IFRIC 14. Specifically, we assessed whether the Society was entitled to an unconditional right of refund.
We assessed this by reference to the terms of the pension agreement and confirmed that the Society
did have such a right.
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements, including the
appropriateness of the assumptions and sensitivities disclosed.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we found the key actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation to be within a reasonable
range and no material differences were identified during our independent valuation of the pension assets. We were also satisfied that the net defined benefit pension asset was recognisable in
accordance with the terms of IFRIC 14 after applying the asset ceiling test.

IT general controls
Group and Society: Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 100)
Key audit matter
The Society is highly dependent on technology due to the significant number of transactions
that are processed daily. Given the levels of automation in place our audit focused on
ensuring that the Society has appropriate levels of IT general controls.

Our response to the key audit matter
We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls over the applications,
operating systems and databases that are relevant to financial reporting. This includes testing change
management, segregation of duties and data transfer controls.

IT general controls are required to ensure that data transfers between applications operate
as expected; and that changes are authorised and tested. Access management controls
reduce the risk of unauthorised access to applications and data.

We tested user access by assessing the controls in place for in-scope applications, in particular testing
the user access provisioning, de-provisioning, privileged access and periodic recertification of users’
access.

The Society also has a dependency, in some areas of the audit, on third parties and related
business teams managing associated IT controls.

Where control deficiencies were identified, we performed IT substantive procedures or alternative
audit procedures to mitigate any residual risk.
Some of the in-scope systems are outsourced to third party service providers. For these systems, we
tested IT general controls through either direct testing or evaluation of the relevant Service
Organisation Controls (“SOC”) reports (where available). This included assessing the timing of the
reporting, the controls tested by the service auditor and whether they address relevant IT risks. We
also tested required complementary user entity controls performed by management. Where a SOC
report was not available we performed substantive testing to address risks to financial reporting.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We are satisfied that IT controls impacting financial reporting are designed and operating effectively.
Improvements were made around user entitlement review execution and change controls. The overall number of control deficiencies identified has reduced in these areas.
Where control exceptions were noted, we have either relied on mitigating controls or performed IT substantive procedures to ensure that the control exceptions identified did not impact our
approach to the financial statement audit.

In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to certain customer redress provisioning. We did not consider this to be a key audit matter in the current year as the
materiality of the specific customer redress provision has decreased significantly. Further, in the current year we have included the new key audit matter in relation to IT general controls due to
increased proportion of audit effort required for testing IT general controls as a proportion of total audit effort.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
Having considered quantitative and qualitative factors and consultation with those charged with governance:
We determined materiality for the Group to be £50 million (2022: £50 million), which is 2.2% (2022: 5%) of the Group’s profit before tax.
We determined materiality for the Society to be £50 million (2022: £50 million), which is 2.0% (2022: 5%) of the Society’s profit before tax.
We assessed profit before tax to be an appropriate basis for materiality given the users of the financial statements, including the Society’s members and regulators, focus on pre-tax profit in
assessing the Society’s performance.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2022: 50%) for the Group
and for the Society of our planning materiality, namely £37.5 million (2022: £25 million). We have increased the percentage of performance materiality from the prior year based on our experience
of misstatements and consistent effectiveness of the control environment.
Audit work for underlying entities for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The
performance materiality set for each entity is based on the relative scale and risk of the entity to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that entity. In the current
year, the performance materiality allocated to entities was £37.5 million.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £2.5 million (2022: £2.5 million) for the Group and Society, which is set at 5% of
planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements as defined above and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible
for the other information contained within the Annual Report, which includes reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (“TCFD”) recommendations. Our opinion on
the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives
rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are
required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Building Societies Act 1986
In our opinion:
•
•
•

The Annual business statement and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Building Societies Act 1986;
The information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
The information given in the Annual business statement (other than the information upon which we are not required to report) gives a true representation of the matters in respect of which it
is given.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Building Societies Act 1986 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

Other voluntary reporting matters
Corporate governance statement
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Society’s voluntary
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement are materially consistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 137;
The directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Society’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 67;
The directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 137;
The Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 65;;
The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 99; and
The section describing the work of the Audit Committee set out on page 102.

Report of the directors on remuneration
The Society voluntarily prepares a Report of the directors on remuneration in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The directors have requested that we audit the part of the
Report of the directors on remuneration specified by the Companies Act 2006 to be audited as if the Society were a quoted company.
In our opinion, the part of the Report of the directors on remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 136, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Society’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Society or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined below, to detect irregularities, including
fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example,
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Society and management.
Our approach was as follows:
−
−
−

−

−

We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant were the regulations, licence conditions and
supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
preparation of the financial statements such as UK adopted International Accounting Standards and the Building Societies Act 1986.
We understood how the Group is complying with these legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, and those responsible for legal and compliance matters.
We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and UK regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and Board Risk Committee; and gained an understanding of the Group’s approach to
governance, demonstrated by the Board’s approval of the Group’s governance framework and the Board’s review of the Group’s operational risk framework and internal control processes.
We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the controls that the Group has established to address
risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. We made enquiries of management and internal audit and held a fraud-focused discussion with EY forensic
specialists and members of the Board to supplement our assessment of how fraud might occur. We also considered performance and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence
management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of investors and stakeholders. Our procedures to address the risks identified also included incorporation of unpredictability into the
nature, timing and/or extent of our testing, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, and testing year-end adjustments and other
targeted journal entries.
Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of internal and external legal counsel,
executive management and internal audit, and reviewing the key policies, reports on the legal and regulatory frameworks and internal whistleblowing logs. With involvement of the relevant
specialists, we also conducted a review of correspondence with and notices from the regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), and gaining an understanding of any regulatory
investigations being undertaken. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the contingent liability disclosures made in note 29 to the financial statements.
The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure
that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.

We were appointed by the Society at the Annual General Meeting in July 2019 and engaged on 2 August 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 4 April 2020 and
subsequent financial periods.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Society and we remain independent of the Group and the Society in conducting the
audit.
The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Society’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 78 of the Building Societies Act 1986. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Society’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Society and the Society’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

1. Statement of accounting policies
Basis of preparation

Going concern

The Group and Society financial statements are prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Building Societies Act 1986
and with those parts of the Building Societies (Accounts and Related Provisions) Regulations
1998 (as amended) that are applicable. International accounting standards which have been
adopted for use within the UK have also been applied in these financial statements.

The Group’s business activities and financial position, the factors likely to affect its future
development and performance, its objectives and policies in managing the financial risks to
which it is exposed, and its capital, funding and liquidity positions are set out in the Financial
review and the Risk report.

The Group financial statements are also prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified
by the revaluation of investment properties, branches and non-specialised buildings, financial
assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and derivatives
and certain other financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss
(FVTPL).
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set
out below. There have been no changes arising from adoption of new and revised IFRSs, as
explained below.
Further information about judgements in applying accounting policies and critical accounting
estimates is provided in note 2.

240

The directors have assessed the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, with reference
to current and anticipated market conditions including the impact of climate-related matters.
The directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
business for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these
consolidated financial statements and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis.
Adoption of new and revised IFRSs
A number of amendments and improvements to accounting standards have been issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with an effective date of 1 January 2022.
Those relevant to these financial statements include minor amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Financial
Instruments’ and the Conceptual Framework. The adoption of these amendments had no
significant impact on the Group.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Future accounting developments

Securitisation and covered bond transactions

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. IFRS 17 is
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The new standard is
not expected to have a significant impact for the Group.

The Group has securitised certain mortgage loans by the transfer of the loans to structured
entities controlled by the Group. The securitisation enables a subsequent issuance of debt,
either by the Society or the structured entities, to investors who gain the security of the
underlying assets as collateral. Those structured entities are fully consolidated into the Group
accounts.

The IASB has also issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs that become effective
from 1 January 2023 or subsequent years, some of which have not yet been endorsed for use
in the UK. These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact for the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The assets, liabilities and results of the Society and its undertakings, which include
subsidiaries and structured entities, are included in the financial statements on the basis of
accounts made up to the reporting date.
The Group consolidates an entity from the date on which the Group: (i) has power over the
entity; (ii) is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity;
and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power. The
assessment of control is based on all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether
it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more
of the three elements of control. The Group ceases to consolidate subsidiaries from the date
that control ceases.
A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding control. Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship
indicates control. The Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity,
the nature of its relationship with the entity, the size of its holding and its exposure to
variability of returns.
Upon consolidation, all intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash
flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the Society accounts at cost less
provisions for any impairment in value. The directors consider it appropriate for
administrative and commercial reasons that subsidiary undertakings have financial years
ending on 31 March. Adjustment is made for individually significant transactions arising
between 31 March and the Society’s year end.

The transfers of the mortgage loans to the structured entities are not treated as sales by the
Society. The Society continues to recognise the mortgage loans on its own balance sheet after
the transfer because it retains their risks and rewards through the receipt of substantially all
of the profits or losses of the structured entities. In the accounts of the Society, the proceeds
received from the transfer are accounted for as a deemed loan repayable to the structured
entities.
For covered bonds, the Society itself and not the structured entity issues the covered bonds
and then lends the proceeds to the structured entity on back-to-back terms. The structured
entity then uses these proceeds as consideration for the loans transferred from the Society. In
the accounts of the Society, neither the loan to the structured entity nor the consideration for
the transfer of mortgage loans is recognised separately as an additional asset and liability.
The Group has also entered into self-issuances of debt to be used as collateral for repurchase
(‘repo’) and similar transactions. Investments in self-issued debt and the related obligation,
together with the related income, expenditure and cash flows, are not recognised in the
Society’s or Group’s financial statements. This avoids the ‘grossing-up’ of the financial
statements that would otherwise arise.
To manage interest rate risk, the Society enters into derivative transactions with the
structured entities, receiving a rate of interest based on the securitised mortgages and paying
a rate inherent in the debt issuances. These internal derivatives are treated as part of the
deemed loan and not separately fair valued because the relevant mortgage loans are not
derecognised. All other derivatives relating to securitisations are treated as explained in the
derivatives and hedge accounting policy below.
Interest receivable and interest expense
For instruments measured at amortised cost the effective interest rate (EIR) method is used
to measure the carrying value of a financial asset or liability and to allocate associated interest
income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial
instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial
asset or financial liability.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
In calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all
contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, early redemption penalty charges)
and anticipated customer behaviour but does not consider future credit losses. The
calculation includes all fees received and paid and costs incurred that are an integral part of
the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts above or
below market rates.
Interest income is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of non-credit
impaired financial assets. For credit impaired financial assets the interest income is
calculated by applying the EIR to the amortised cost of the credit impaired financial assets
(i.e. net of the allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs)). Where loans are credit impaired
on origination, or when purchased from third parties, the carrying amount at initial
recognition is net of the lifetime ECL at that date. For these assets the EIR reflects the ECLs in
determining the future cash flows expected to be received from the financial asset.
Interest receivable and similar income/(expense) calculated using the effective interest rate
method also includes interest on financial assets classified as fair value through other
comprehensive income, and on derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships.
Interest income not calculated using the effective interest rate method, including interest on
financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss and derivatives not in qualifying
hedge relationships, is presented as other interest receivable and similar income/(expense).
Fees and commissions
Fee and commission income and expense comprises fees that are not an integral part of the
EIR. Fees and commissions relating to current accounts, savings accounts, mortgages and
credit cards are either:
•
•

transaction-based and therefore recognised when the performance obligation related to
the transaction is fulfilled, or
related to the provision of services over a period of time and therefore recognised on a
systematic basis over the life of the agreement as services are provided.

The transaction prices and provision of services are defined within the product terms and
conditions.

242

Trail commission relating to investments under administration, general insurance and
protection products sold on behalf of third parties may include variable consideration. Where
this is the case the trail commission is recognised either on the accruals basis over the period
to which the commission relates or, if the uncertainties are more significant, once the
uncertainties are resolved.
Fee and commission income is generally earned from short-term contracts with payment
terms that do not include a significant financing component.
Segmental reporting
The Executive Committee (ExCo) is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the
performance of the business and is therefore identified as the chief operating decision maker.
The Group has determined that it has one reportable segment as the ExCo reviews
performance and makes decisions based on the Group as whole. No segmental analysis is
required on geographical lines as substantially all of the Group’s activities are in the United
Kingdom. As a result, no segmental disclosure is provided.
Leases
At inception, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. This assessment
involves exercising judgement as to whether the contract conveys the right to control the use
of an identified asset, and the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from
this asset, for a period of time. The leases held by the Group as a lessee consist primarily of
property contracts for branches and office buildings.
The Group recognises a right-of-use (RoU) asset and a lease liability at the commencement of
the lease, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of less than 12
months) and leases of low value assets. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low
value assets are generally recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the payments over the lease
term, with the rate used to discount the payments reflecting the rate implicit in the lease or, if
this is not readily determinable, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease term
includes the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with an assessment of any
extension or termination options which are reasonably certain to be exercised. After the
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of
interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease
liabilities is remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment to the RoU asset) when there is a
change in future lease payments due to a modification of lease terms, changes to an index or
rate, or a reassessment of options.
The RoU asset is initially measured based on the value of the corresponding lease liability,
plus any initial direct costs and any lease payments made at or before the commencement,
less any incentives received. The RoU asset is subsequently measured at cost less
depreciation and any accumulated impairment. Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. The Group applies IAS 36 ‘Impairment of
Assets’ to determine whether a RoU asset is impaired, as described in the property, plant and
equipment accounting policy. RoU assets are included in the ‘Property, plant and equipment’
balance sheet line item and the lease liabilities are included in the ‘Other liabilities’ line item.
All leases of owned properties where the Group is lessor are classified as operating leases, as
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have been retained. When the Group is an
intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate
contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the RoU
asset arising from the head lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at
the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases and finance lease income is allocated
to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets held by the Group consist primarily of externally acquired and internally
developed computer software which is held at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment. In accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, software development costs are
capitalised if it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and
those benefits can be controlled by the Group. Costs incurred to establish technological
feasibility or to maintain existing levels of performance are recognised as an expense.

Web development costs are capitalised where the expenditure is incurred on developing an
income generating website.
Where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs incurred in the construction of
qualifying assets are capitalised.
Computer software intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives which generally range between 3 and 10 years. Amortisation
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Estimated useful lives are
reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate, in the light of technological developments,
usage and other relevant factors.
Intangible assets, including computer software, are reviewed for indicators of impairment at
each reporting date and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying amount is not recoverable the
asset is written down immediately to the estimated recoverable amount. The estimated
recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations where there is no basis for making a
reliable estimate of fair value less costs of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold and long leasehold properties comprise mainly branches and office buildings.
Branches and non-specialised buildings are stated at revalued amounts, being the fair value,
determined by market-based evidence at the date of the valuation, less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment. Valuations are completed annually as
at 4 April, or more frequently if required, by external, independent and qualified surveyors
who have recent experience in the location and type of properties. Valuations are performed
in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation
Standards and are generally performed on a vacant possession basis, using a comparative
method of valuation with reference to sales prices and observable market rents for similar
properties in similar locations.
Increases in the valuations of branches and non-specialised buildings are credited to other
comprehensive income except where they reverse decreases for the same asset previously
recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase in the valuation is recognised
in the income statement. Decreases in valuations are recognised in the income statement
except where they reverse amounts previously credited to other comprehensive income for
the same asset, in which case the decrease in valuation is recognised in other comprehensive
income.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
The Group holds a small number of investment properties comprising properties held for
rental. These properties may include both owned properties and leased properties for which
the RoU asset is held for rental under an operating sublease. Investment properties are stated
at fair value, determined by market-based evidence at the date of the valuation. Valuations of
owned properties are completed annually as at 4 April, or more frequently if required, by
external, independent and qualified surveyors. The fair value of an investment property which
is a RoU asset reflects the expected cash flows to be received under its sublease. Changes in
fair value are included in the income statement. Depreciation is not charged on investment
properties.
Other property, plant and equipment, including specialised administration buildings, are
included at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items, major
alterations and refurbishments.
Where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs incurred in the construction of
qualifying assets are capitalised.
Land is not depreciated. The depreciation of other assets commences when the assets are
ready for their intended use and is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their
cost or valuation over the following estimated useful lives:
Branches and non-specialised buildings
Specialised administration buildings
Plant and machinery
Equipment, fixtures, fittings and vehicles

60 years
up to 60 years
5 to 15 years
3 to 10 years

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjusted, if appropriate,
in light of technological developments, usage and other relevant factors.
Assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying amount is not recoverable the asset is written down immediately to the
estimated recoverable amount. The estimated recoverable amount is based on value in use
calculations where there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of fair value less costs of
disposal.
Gains and losses on disposals are included in other operating income in the income
statement.

244

Taxation
Current tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which profits arise.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from,
or paid to, the taxation authorities. Accounting for taxation involves estimation and
judgement in relation to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to
interpretation. Management evaluates where uncertain taxation positions exist and
recognises provisions where appropriate to reflect the best estimate of the probable outcome.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised,
or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The tax effects of tax losses
available for carry forward are recognised as a deferred tax asset when it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred tax assets and
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the
extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a
different period, outside the income statement (for example, in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity). In this case, the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction
that gave rise to it. An exception to this principle relates to the tax consequences of the
Group's distributions on other equity instruments. Although such distributions are recognised
directly in equity, the tax consequences are credited to the income statement, where the
profit being distributed originally arose.

Employee benefits

(b) Other post-retirement obligations

(a) Pensions

The Group provides post-retirement healthcare to a small number of former employees. The
Group recognises this obligation and the actuarial remeasurement in a similar manner to the
defined benefit pension plans.

The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension
arrangements.

(c) Other long-term employee benefits
Defined benefit pension arrangements
A defined benefit plan is one that defines the benefit an employee will receive on retirement,
depending on such factors as age, length of service and salary.
The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit
obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets, after applying the asset ceiling test, where
a net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and
reductions in future contributions to the plan. Refunds of a surplus are not considered to be
available if the right to a surplus depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or
more uncertain future events not wholly within an entity’s control. The rights of third parties,
such as trustees, are considered in assessing the extent to which a surplus can be recognised.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash flows derived from yields of high-quality corporate
bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

The cost of bonuses and other long-term employee benefits payable 12 months or more after
the end of the year in which they are earned is accrued over the period from the start of the
performance year until all relevant criteria have been met.
(d) Short-term employee benefits
The cost of short-term employee benefits, including wages and salaries, social security costs
and healthcare for current employees, is recognised in the year of service.
Provisions
A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is
probable that the obligation will be settled, and it can be reliably estimated. This includes
management’s best estimate of amounts payable for customer redress.

Actuarial remeasurements arise from experience adjustments (the effects of differences
between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred) and changes in
forward-looking actuarial assumptions. Actuarial remeasurements are recognised in full, in
the year they occur, in other comprehensive income.

The Group has an obligation to contribute to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
(FSCS) to enable the FSCS to meet compensation claims from, in particular, retail depositors
of failed banks. A provision is recognised, to the extent that it can be reliably estimated, when
the levy is legally enforceable, in line with IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’. The amount provided is based on
information received from the FSCS and the Group’s historic share of industry protected
deposits.

Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Financial assets

Defined contribution pension arrangements

Financial assets comprise cash, loans and advances to banks and similar institutions,
investment securities, derivative financial instruments and loans and advances to customers.

A defined contribution arrangement is one into which the Group and the employee pay fixed
contributions, without any further obligation to pay additional contributions. Payments to
defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.

Recognition and derecognition

(a) Amortised cost

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. Purchases and sales of financial assets
are accounted for at trade date. Financial assets acquired through a business combination or
portfolio acquisition are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or where the assets have
been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred.

Financial assets held to collect contractual cash flows and where contractual terms comprise
solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are classified as amortised cost. This category
of financial assets includes cash, loans and advances to banks and similar institutions, the
majority of the Group’s residential and commercial mortgage loans, all unsecured lending,
and certain investment securities within a ‘hold to collect’ business model.

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price
(plus directly attributable transaction costs for financial assets which are not subsequently
measured at fair value through profit or loss). On initial recognition, it is presumed that the
transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active
market to the contrary. Any difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the
transaction price is recognised immediately as a gain or loss in the income statement where
the fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation using only
observable market data. In all other cases, any gain or loss is deferred and recognised over
the life of the transaction, or until valuation inputs become observable.
Modification of contractual terms
An instrument that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and
a new agreement is made on substantially different terms (such as renegotiations of
commercial loans). Residential mortgages reaching the end of a fixed interest deal period are
deemed repricing events, rather than a modification of contractual terms, as the change in
interest rate at the end of the fixed rate period was envisaged in the original mortgage
contract.
Where an instrument is renegotiated and not derecognised, the change is considered a
modification of contractual terms. Where this arises, the gross carrying amount of the loan is
recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows,
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Any gain or loss on recalculation is
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Classification and measurement
The classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets is based on an assessment
of the Group’s business models for managing the assets and their contractual cash flow
characteristics. Financial assets are classified into the following three categories:

246

Financial assets within this category are recognised on either the receipt of cash or deposit of
funds into one of the Group’s bank accounts (for cash and loans and advances to banks and
similar institutions), when the funds are advanced to borrowers (for residential, commercial
and unsecured lending) or on the trade date for purchases of investment securities. After
initial recognition, the assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provisions for expected credit losses.
(b) Fair value through other comprehensive income
Debt instruments held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and where contractual terms comprise
solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), are classified and measured at FVOCI. This
category of financial assets includes most of the Group’s investment securities which are held
to manage liquidity requirements.
Financial assets within this category are recognised on trade date. The assets are measured
at fair value using, in the majority of cases, market prices or, where there is no active market,
prices obtained from market participants. In sourcing valuations, the Group makes use of a
consensus pricing service, in line with standard industry practice. In cases where market
prices or prices from market participants are not available, discounted cash flow models are
used.
Interest on FVOCI debt instruments is recognised in interest receivable and similar income in
the income statement, using the effective interest rate method. Unrealised gains and losses
arising from changes in value are recognised in other comprehensive income. Provisions for
expected credit losses and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income
statement. Cumulative gains or losses arising on sale of FVOCI debt instruments are
recognised in the income statement within other operating income/(expense), net of any
credit or foreign exchange gains or losses already recognised.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Upon initial recognition, the Group may elect to classify irrevocably some of its equity
investments as FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Presentation’ and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on
an instrument-by instrument basis. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never
recycled to profit. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income unless
deemed to represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Equity instruments at
FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.
(c) Fair value through profit or loss
All other financial assets are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets within this category
primarily include derivative instruments and a small number of residential and commercial
loans and investment securities with contractual cash flow characteristics which do not meet
the SPPI criteria. The contractual terms for these cash flows include contingent or leverage
features, or returns based on movements in underlying collateral values such as house prices.
Fair values are based on observable market data, valuations obtained from third parties or,
where these are not available, internal models. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value of these instruments and on disposal are recognised in the income statement within
other operating income.
Hedge accounting is not applied to assets classified as FVTPL; however, hedging may be
applied for economic purposes. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of
derivatives economically hedging FVTPL financial assets are also included within other
operating income.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) requirements comprise
all financial debt instruments measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI. These include
cash, loans and advances to banks and similar institutions, and the majority of investment
securities and loans and advances to customers. Also within scope are irrevocable undrawn
commitments to lend and intra-group lending (the latter being eliminated on consolidation in
the Group accounts).
The ECL represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls following the default of a
financial instrument, including any undrawn commitment. A cash shortfall is the difference
between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the
instrument and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.

The allowance for ECLs is based on an assessment of the probability of default, exposure at
default and loss given default, discounted at the effective interest rate to give a net present
value of cash flows. The estimation of ECLs is unbiased and probability weighted, taking into
account all reasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking economic
assumptions and a range of possible outcomes. ECLs are typically calculated from initial
recognition of the financial asset for the maximum contractual period that the Group is
exposed to the credit risk. However, for revolving credit loans such as credit cards and
overdrafts, the Group’s credit risk is not limited to their contractual period and therefore the
expected life of the loan and associated undrawn commitment is calculated based on the
behavioural life of the loan.
For financial assets recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost, the allowance for ECLs
is offset against the gross carrying value so that the amount presented in the balance sheet is
net of impairment provisions. For financial assets classified as FVOCI, any credit losses
recognised are offset against cumulative fair value movements within the other
comprehensive income reserve. For separately identifiable irrevocable loan commitments,
where the related financial asset has not yet been advanced, the provision is presented in
provisions for liabilities and charges in the balance sheet.
Forward-looking economic inputs
ECLs are calculated by reference to information on past events, current conditions and
forecasts of future economic conditions. Multiple economic scenarios are incorporated into
ECL calculation models. These scenarios are based on external sources where available and
appropriate, and internally generated assumptions in all other cases. To capture any nonlinear relationship between economic assumptions and credit losses, a minimum of four
scenarios is used. This includes a base case scenario which reflects the Group’s view of the
most likely future economic conditions, together with upside, downside and severe downside
scenarios representing alternative plausible views of economic conditions, weighted based on
management’s view of their probability.
Credit risk categorisation
For the purpose of calculating ECLs, assets are categorised into three 'stages' as follows:
Stage 1: no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition
On initial recognition, and for financial assets where there has not been a significant increase
in credit risk since the date of advance, provision is made for losses from credit default events
expected to occur within the next 12 months. Expected credit losses for these stage 1 assets
continue to be recognised on this basis unless there is a significant increase in the credit risk
of the asset.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Stage 2: significant increase in credit risk
Financial assets are categorised as being within stage 2 where an instrument has
experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For these assets,
provision is made for losses from credit default events expected to occur over the lifetime of
the instrument.
Whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred is ascertained by considering both
quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative considerations take into account changes in
the residual lifetime probability of default (PD) of the asset. As a backstop, all assets with an
arrears status of more than 30 days past due on contractual payments are considered to be in
stage 2.
Qualitative factors that may indicate a significant change in credit risk include concession
events where full repayment of principal and interest is envisaged, on a discounted basis.
Further information about the identification of significant increases in credit risk is provided
in note 10.
Stage 3: credit impaired (or defaulted) loans
Financial assets are transferred into stage 3 when there is objective evidence that an
instrument is credit impaired. Provisions for stage 3 assets are made on the basis of credit
default events expected to occur over the lifetime of the instrument. Assets are considered
credit impaired when:
•
•

•

Contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due by more than 90 days;
There are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay such as signs of financial
difficulty, probable bankruptcy, breaches of contract and concession events which have a
detrimental impact on the present value of future cash flows; or
The loan is otherwise considered to be in default.

Interest income on stage 3 credit impaired loans is recognised in the income statement on
the loan balance net of the ECL provision. The gross balance sheet value of stage 3 loans
reflects the contractual terms of the assets and continues to increase over time with the
contractually accrued interest.
Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) loans
Where loans are credit impaired on origination, or when purchased from third parties,
lifetime ECLs are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate on initial
recognition. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance on initial
recognition, and the amount recognised as a loss allowance subsequently is equal to the
248

changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition of the asset discounted at the credit
impaired EIR. POCI loans are separately disclosed as credit impaired loans and cannot be
transferred out of the POCI designation, even if there is a significant improvement in credit
quality.
Transfers between stages
Transfers from stage 1 to 2 occur when there has been a significant increase in credit risk and
from stage 2 to 3 when credit impairment is indicated as described above.
Loans in stage 2 or 3 can transfer back to stage 1 or 2 once the criteria for a significant
increase in credit risk or impairment are no longer met. For loans subject to concession
events deemed to be forbearance, accounts are transferred back to stage 1 or 2 only after
being up to date for a period of 12 months.
Write-off
Loans remain on the balance sheet, net of associated provisions, until they are deemed to
have no reasonable expectation of recovery. Loans are generally written off after realisation of
any proceeds from collateral and upon conclusion of the collections process, including
consideration of whether an account has reached a point where continuing attempts to
recover are no longer likely to be successful. Where a loan is not recoverable, it is written off
against the related provision for loan impairment once all the necessary procedures have
been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of
amounts previously written off decrease the value of impairment charges recorded in the
income statement.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings, including shares, deposits, debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and
permanent interest-bearing shares (subscribed capital) are recognised initially at fair value,
being the issue proceeds net of premiums, discounts and transaction costs incurred.
All borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Amortised cost is adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums, discounts and
transaction costs. The amortisation is recognised in interest expense and similar charges
using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial liabilities are measured at FVTPL. Borrowings that are designated as
hedged items are subject to measurement under the hedge accounting requirements
described in the derivatives and hedge accounting policy below.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or has
expired. The financial liabilities of dormant shares and deposit accounts are extinguished
when balances have been transferred to the Government-backed unclaimed asset scheme
under the terms of the Dormant Accounts and Building Society Accounts Act 2008 with no
impact on the income statement.
Fair value of assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ requires an entity to classify assets and liabilities held at fair
value, and those not measured at fair value but for which the fair value is disclosed, according
to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs in calculating those
fair values. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below:
Level 1 – Valuation using quoted market prices
Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price reflects
actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. An active market
is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 – Valuation technique using observable inputs
Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are
observable in an active market. Valuations based on observable inputs include derivative
financial instruments such as swaps and forward rate agreements which are valued using
market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where
all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable. They also include
investment securities valued using consensus pricing or other observable market prices.
Level 3 – Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs

Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are entered into to reduce exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange
rates, market indices and credit risk, and are not used for speculative purposes.
(a) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair values recorded in the income
statement. Derivative financial instruments are principally valued by discounted cash flow
models using yield curves that are based on observable market data or on valuations obtained
from third parties. Discounting uses the appropriate risk-free rate for the currency of the cash
flow; for example, GBP cash flows are discounted using a Sonia yield curve. GBP Libor is no
longer used for discounting following its discontinuation in December 2021.
In the first instance fair values are calculated using mid prices. An adjustment is then made to
derivative assets and liabilities to value them on a bid and offer basis respectively. The bidoffer adjustment is calculated on a portfolio basis and reflects the costs that would be
incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed out using available
hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding actual positions. The methodology for
determining the bid-offer adjustments involves netting between long and short positions and
the grouping of risk by type, in accordance with the hedging strategy. Bid-offer spreads are
derived from market sources such as broker data and are reviewed periodically.
In measuring fair value, separate credit valuation and debit valuation adjustments are made
for counterparty or own credit risk to the extent not already included in the valuation.
Funding valuation adjustments are also made to reflect an estimate of the adjustment a
market participant would make to incorporate funding costs and benefits that arise in relation
to derivative exposures.
All derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where
their fair value is negative. Where there is the legal right and intention to settle net, then the
derivative is classified as a net asset or liability, as appropriate.

Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs
that are not based on observable market data. A valuation input is considered observable if it
can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling
external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. An input is deemed significant if it
is shown to contribute more than 10% to the valuation of a financial instrument.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Where cash collateral is received, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due to the Group, it
is included as a liability within deposits from banks and similar institutions. Similarly, where
cash collateral is given, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due from the Group, it is
included as an asset in loans and advances to banks and similar institutions. Where securities
collateral is received the securities are not recognised in the accounts as the Group does not
obtain the risks and rewards of the securities. Where securities collateral is given, the
securities are not derecognised as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

Fair value and cash flow hedges may have residual hedge ineffectiveness. This is the degree
to which the change in fair value of the hedging instrument does not offset the change in fair
value of the hedged item. This ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement and
typically arises from:
•
•
•

(b) Embedded derivatives
•

Some complex contracts may be hybrid in nature, in that a derivative element is included
within a non-derivative host contract, in which case the derivative is termed an embedded
derivative. If the host contract is an asset within the scope of IFRS 9 the entire contract has its
accounting classification assessed under IFRS 9. If the host contract is a liability or an asset
which does not fall within the scope of IFRS 9, the embedded derivative is separated and
treated as a standalone derivative instrument if:
•
•
•

Its economic characteristics are not closely related to the host;
A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative; and
The hybrid contract is not already being fair valued through the income statement.

(c) Hedge accounting
The Group has adopted the general hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 but continues
to apply the scope exception which allows ongoing application of IAS 39 for fair value hedge
accounting for a portfolio (macro) hedge of interest rate risk. When transactions meet the
criteria specified in IFRS 9, the Group can apply two types of hedge accounting: either hedges
of the changes in fair value of the financial asset or liability (fair value hedge accounting) or
hedges of the variability in cash flows of the financial asset or liability (cash flow hedge
accounting). The Group does not have hedges of net investments.
At inception each hedge relationship is formally documented, including a description of the
hedged item (a financial asset or liability which is being economically hedged) and the
hedging instrument (a derivative), as well as the methods which will be used to assess the
effectiveness of the hedge. Hedges accounted for under IFRS 9 are required to be effective on
a prospective basis, in line with risk management strategy. Macro hedges which continue to
be accounted for under IAS 39 are required to be highly effective on both a retrospective and
a prospective basis.

Differences in the market curves used to value the hedged item and hedging instrument;
Unexpected adjustments to either the hedged item or hedging instrument, due to early
repayments or disposals; or
The ongoing amortisation of any existing balance sheet mismatch between the fair value
of the hedged item and hedging instrument.

The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
•
•
•

It is evident from testing that a hedging instrument ceases to meet the hedge
effectiveness requirements;
The hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or
The hedged item matures, is sold or repaid or, in the case of a forecasted item, is no
longer deemed to be highly probable to occur.

For macro hedges which continue to be accounted for under IAS 39, the Group may also
decide to prospectively cease hedge accounting even though the hedge relationship
continues to be highly effective, by ceasing to designate the financial instrument as a hedge.
For hedges accounted for under IFRS 9, the Group is unable to voluntarily de-designate
hedging relationships, unless there has been a change to risk management objectives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Fair value hedge accounting results in the carrying value of the hedged item being adjusted
to reflect changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. This creates an offset to
the fair value movements of the hedging instrument. Changes in the fair value of the hedged
items and hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, except for changes in
the fair value of hedging instruments accounted for under IFRS 9 which are attributable to
foreign currency basis spreads. Where foreign currency basis spreads are excluded from
hedge designation, this element of fair valuation of the hedging instrument is instead
recognised directly within equity within the ‘other hedging reserve’.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
For larger and distinctively identifiable assets and liabilities, such as investment securities and
debt securities in issue, a single or small number of hedging instruments may be used. This is
referred to as a micro fair value hedge. If the hedge is effective, the Group adjusts the carrying
value of that specific asset or liability to reflect changes in its fair value due to movements in
the designated benchmark rate, such as Sonia. This creates an offset to the fair value
movement of the hedging instruments.
For hedged items which are classified as FVOCI, such as investment securities, there is no
further need to adjust their carrying value as they are already held at fair value. Instead,
hedge accounting results in an amount being removed from the FVOCI reserve and instead
reported in the income statement, to create an offset to the change in fair value of the
hedging instrument.
For balances within portfolios of homogeneous instruments, such as mortgages, savings and
commercial loans, derivatives may be used to hedge risks on a portfolio basis. The Group
creates separate portfolio (macro) hedges for assets and liabilities. The Group determines the
hedged item by identifying portfolios of similar assets or liabilities and scheduling the
expected future cash flows from these items into repricing time buckets, based on expected
rather than actual repricing dates. A portion of the total cash flow from each time bucket is
then included in the hedged item. The size of this portion is set so that it is expected to create
a highly effective fair value offset to the equivalent future cash flows from the hedging
instruments. If the hedge is highly effective the Group records an adjustment in the fair value
adjustment for portfolio hedged risk category on the balance sheet. Macro hedges are
frequently rebalanced to include new business.
In fair value hedge accounting relationships, if the hedging instrument no longer meets the
criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative fair value hedge adjustment is amortised over
the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship. If the hedged item is
sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is immediately recognised in the
income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting

Amounts deferred to the cash flow hedge reserve are subsequently recycled to the income
statement. This recycling occurs when the underlying asset or liability being hedged impacts
the income statement, for example when interest payments are recognised. In cash flow
hedge accounting relationships, if the derivative no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, the cumulative gain or loss from the effective portion of the movement in the fair
value of the derivative remains in other comprehensive income until the cash flows from the
underlying hedged item are recognised in the income statement or are no longer expected to
occur. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the cumulative gain or loss in other
comprehensive income is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported on the balance sheet if,
and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities borrowing and lending)
Investment and other securities may be lent or sold subject to a commitment to repurchase
them at a pre-determined price (a repo). Such securities are retained on the balance sheet
when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership (typically, the interest rate risk and
credit risk on the asset) remain within the Group, and the counterparty liability is included
separately on the balance sheet within deposits from banks and similar institutions as
appropriate.
Similarly, where the Group borrows or purchases securities subject to a commitment to resell
them (a reverse repo) but does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, the
transactions are treated as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks and
similar institutions, and the securities are not included on the balance sheet.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is accrued over the life of the agreements
using the effective interest rate method.

In a cash flow hedge accounting relationship, the portion of the hedging instrument’s fair
value movement that is deemed to be an effective hedge is deferred to the cash flow hedge
reserve, instead of being immediately recognised in the income statement. The ineffective
portion of the derivative fair value movement is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)
Equity instruments

Cash and cash equivalents

Issued financial instruments are classified as equity instruments where the contractual
arrangement with the holder does not result in the Group having a present obligation to
deliver cash, another financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments. Where the
Group does have a present obligation, the instrument is classified as a financial liability.

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances
with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition, included within cash and
loans and advances to banks and similar institutions on the balance sheet.

The proceeds of the issuance of equity instruments are included in equity. Costs incurred that
are incremental and directly attributable to the issuance are deducted from the proceeds (net
of applicable tax).
Distributions to holders of equity instruments are recognised when they become irrevocable
and are deducted from the general reserve.
Own equity instruments that are reacquired, referred to as treasury shares, are recognised at
cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase,
sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the share premium.
Inventories
Inventories relating to property development activities are held at the lower of cost and net
realisable value and are included within other assets on the balance sheet. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion
and costs to be incurred in marketing and selling.
Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional
currency of the Society. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s
entities are measured using sterling which is also the functional currency of each entity.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at
the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation
and settlement of these items are recognised in the income statement as disclosed in note 7.

252

Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the
outcome of uncertain future events, and present obligations where the outflow of resources is
uncertain or cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the
balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is
remote.
IFRS disclosures
The audited sections in the Risk report and the Report of the directors on remuneration form
an integral part of these financial statements. These disclosures (where marked as ‘audited’)
are covered by the Independent auditor’s report for this Annual Report and Accounts.

2. Judgements in applying accounting policies and critical accounting estimates
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS involves management making judgements and estimates when applying those accounting policies that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from those on which management’s estimates are based. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated
and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. For the year ended 4 April 2023, this evaluation has considered
the impact of climate-related risks on the Group’s financial position and performance. While the effects of climate change represent a source of uncertainty, the Group does not consider there to be
a material impact on its judgements and estimates from physical and transition risks of climate change in the short to medium term.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or areas involving significant sources of estimation uncertainty made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies are disclosed
in the following notes.

7. Losses from derivatives and hedge accounting
As a part of its risk management strategy, the Group uses derivatives to economically hedge financial assets and liabilities. More information on how the Group manages market risk can be found in
the Risk report. Hedge accounting is employed by the Group to minimise the accounting volatility associated with the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments. This volatility does not
reflect the economic reality of the Group’s hedging strategy. The Group only uses derivatives for the hedging of risks; however, income statement volatility can still arise due to hedge accounting
ineffectiveness or because hedge accounting is either not applied or is not currently achievable. The overall impact of derivatives will remain volatile from period to period as new derivative
transactions replace those which mature to ensure that interest rate and other market risks are continually managed.
Note 1 describes how fair value and cash flow hedge accounting affect the financial statements and the main sources of the residual hedge ineffectiveness remaining in the income statement.
Further information on the current derivative portfolio and the allocation to hedge accounting types is included in note 15.

Fair value hedge accounting
Interest rate and currency derivatives are used to economically hedge the fair value of fixed rate assets and liabilities. The market risk from fixed rate assets and liabilities may be netted down before
deciding to use derivatives. The derivatives used are predominantly interest rate swaps, which convert fixed rate cash flows to a benchmark floating rate such as Sonia, and cross currency swaps
which convert foreign currency cash flows to GBP cash flows. In addition, bond forwards are used to reduce swap spread risk within the investment securities portfolio and inflation swaps are used
to economically hedge contractual inflation risk within investment securities. The table below provides further information on the Group’s fair value hedges:

Hedged item

Notes:
i. The Group does not include cross currency basis spreads within its hedge accounting relationships. The change in fair value is instead deferred to an ‘other hedging reserve’ and so is not included in the change in
value of the hedging instrument.
ii. Some of the Group’s loans and advances to customers have been included as hedged items in macro fair value hedges of interest rate risk. The accumulated fair value hedge adjustment includes £(5,011) million
(2022: £(2,443)million) which is recognised in the separate balance sheet asset ‘fair value adjustment for portfolio hedged risk.’ The remaining amount relates to the fair value adjustment to commercial loans in a
micro fair value hedge accounting relationship and is included in the carrying value of these loans as shown in note 14.
iii. Shares are no longer designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result, the carrying amount of the hedged item presented in the table above represents the value of the historic hedge adjustments
remaining from previous hedge relationships, which are amortising over the life of the shares.

The Group’s risk management approach may involve creating future cash flow certainty. The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge non-sterling investment securities, debt
securities in issue and subordinated liabilities. A portion of the interest rate flows within these derivatives has been included as a hedging instrument in cash flow hedges. In addition, inflation swaps
are used to hedge RPI-linked debt securities in issue. The table below provides further information on the Group’s cash flow hedges:

10. Impairment charge/release and provisions on loans and advances to customers (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Impairment is measured as the impact of credit risk on the present value of management’s estimate of future cash flows. In determining the required level of impairment provisions, outputs from
statistical models are used, and judgements incorporated to determine the probability of default (PD), the exposure at default (EAD), and the loss given default (LGD) for each loan. Provisions
represent a probability weighted average of these calculations under multiple economic scenarios. Adjustments are made in modelling provisions, applying further judgements to reflect model
limitations, or to deal with instances where insufficient data exists to fully reflect credit risks in the models.
The most significant areas of judgement are:
•
•

The approach to identifying significant increases in credit risk; and
The approach to identifying credit impaired loans.

The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty are:
•
•

The use of forward-looking economic information using multiple economic scenarios; and
The additional judgements made in modelling expected credit losses (ECL) – these currently include PD uplifts relating to the current economic uncertainty and property valuation risk arising
from fire safety issues.

The Group has considered the potential impact of climate change on impairment provisions beyond their impact on economic assumptions and has concluded that an adjustment to modelled
provisions is not currently appropriate. The expected physical risks are likely to be longer term in nature and, therefore, are likely to have a limited impact on the Group’s existing lending due to the
impact of loan amortisation and redemptions. Future transition policies and the Group’s response to these policies is still highly uncertain. Therefore, the Group cannot yet reliably measure the
impacts on impairment provisions. The Group will continue to monitor this risk.
Identifying significant increases in credit risk (stage 2)
Loans are allocated to stage 1 or stage 2 according to whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Judgement has been used to select both quantitative and qualitative criteria which
are used to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk has taken place. These criteria are detailed within the Credit risk section of the Risk report. The primary quantitative indicators are
the outputs of internal credit risk assessments. While different approaches are used within each portfolio, the intention is to combine current and historical data relating to the exposure with
forward-looking economic information to determine the probability of default (PD) at each reporting date. For residential mortgage and consumer banking lending, the main indicators of a
significant increase in credit risk are either of the following:
•
•

The residual lifetime PD exceeds a benchmark determined by reference to the maximum credit risk that would have been accepted at origination; or
The residual lifetime PD is at least 75 basis points more than, and at least double, the original lifetime PD.

These complementary criteria have been reviewed through detailed back-testing, using management performance indicators and actual default experience, and found to be effective in capturing
events which would constitute a significant increase in credit risk.
Identifying credit impaired loans (stage 3)
The identification of credit impaired loans is an important judgement within the staging approach. A loan is credit impaired either if it has an arrears status of more than 90 days past due,
or is considered to be in default, or it is considered unlikely that the borrower will repay the outstanding balance in full, without recourse to actions such as realising security.

10. Impairment charge/release and provisions on loans and advances to customers (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Use of forward-looking economic information
Management exercises judgement in estimating future economic conditions which are incorporated into provisions through modelling of multiple scenarios. The economic scenarios are reviewed
and updated on a quarterly basis. The provision recognised is the probability-weighted sum of the provisions calculated under a range of economic scenarios. The scenarios and associated
probability weights are derived using external data and statistical methodologies, together with management judgement. The Group continues to model four economic scenarios, which together
encompass an appropriate range of potential economic outcomes. The base case scenario is aligned to the Society’s financial planning process. The upside and downside scenarios are reasonably
likely favourable and adverse alternatives to the base case, and the severe downside scenario is aligned with the Society’s internal stress testing. The impact of applying multiple economic scenarios
(MES) is to increase provisions at 4 April 2023 by £125 million (2022: £98 million), compared with provisions based on the base case economic scenario.
Probability weightings for each scenario are reviewed quarterly and updated to reflect economic conditions as they evolve. The changes in scenario weightings during the period primarily reflect a
deterioration in the economic outlook. The base case and downside scenario weightings increased (and upside scenario weighting decreased) to reflect increased risks associated with rising
inflation, increases in Bank rate and the ongoing economic consequences of the conflict in Ukraine. The probability weightings applied to the scenarios are shown in the table below.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
In the base case scenario at 4 April 2023, a modest recession is forecast, with a fall in GDP of 1.1% expected in 2023. This contraction in the economy is expected to result in an increase in the
forecast peak unemployment rate to 5.0% (2022: 4.2%) in this scenario. The peak unemployment in the downside scenario of 7.0% is unchanged from 4 April 2022 and reflects a significant
economic downturn. The peak unemployment in the severe downside scenario of 10.0% is also unchanged from 4 April 2022, reflecting a severe long-lasting impact on the UK economy.
House prices are expected to fall in the short term in the base case scenario. This is the result of ongoing affordability pressures due to increasing borrowing costs and inflation. The downside
scenario assumes more significant house price falls during both 2023 and 2024, driven by a deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in unemployment, whilst the severe
downside scenario includes a fall in house prices of 34% from December 2022 to the trough. As a result, the weighted average of all scenarios represents a fall in house prices by 12% between
December 2022 and December 2024.
The Bank rate is assumed to remain at 4.25% during 2023 in the base case scenario. Inflation in this scenario is expected to reduce during 2023 to 4%; however, the severe downside scenario
includes a sustained high level of inflation throughout 2023. In the downside scenario the Bank rate is low from 2024 onwards, reflecting the risk that there is a significant economic downturn, with
a reduction in the Bank rate required to stimulate economic demand.
The graphs below show the historical and forecast GDP level, average house price and unemployment rate for the Group’s current economic scenarios, as well as the previous base case economic
scenario:

PD uplift for economic uncertainty
Household disposable income is forecast to decrease in each of the four economic scenarios, increasing the risk that borrowers will not be able to meet their contractual repayments. At 4 April 2022
the main driver of this reduction was the impact of rising inflation, which particularly affected consumer banking portfolios. Since 4 April 2022 there has also been a significant increase in interest
rates, which will again reduce household disposable income but with a greater impact on residential mortgage affordability. In addition, model inputs relating to borrower credit quality are still
benefitting from credit indicators which are judged to be temporary, such as reduced levels of arrears.
This adjustment reflects the cumulative effect of increasing the probability of default to reflect management’s judgements for all of these risks. At 4 April 2023 this has increased provisions by
£177 million (2022: £159 million). The adjustment also results in approximately £16.6 billion (2022: £4.6 billion) of residential mortgages and £585 million (2022: £700 million) of consumer banking
balances moving from stage 1 to stage 2. The most significant judgement within this adjustment is the assumed increase in both fixed and variable mortgage rates faced by borrowers over the next
two years. A 1% increase in assumed mortgage rates would increase residential mortgage provisions by £32 million.
LGD uplift for property valuation risks
An adjustment is made to reflect the property valuation risk associated with flats subject to fire safety issues such as unsuitable cladding. Due to limited data available to identify affected properties
individually, it is assumed that a proportion of the flats securing loans in the residential mortgage portfolios is affected, in line with UK market exposure estimates. Assumptions relating to property
values have been applied based upon the height of the affected buildings. The provision adjustment is £22 million (2022: £25 million). Although initiatives to support remediation of affected
properties have made progress over the past year, we continue to hold an adjustment to provisions whilst there is insufficient evidence of a recovery in the value of affected properties.

Deferred tax
It was announced in the Budget on 3 March 2021 that the main rate of corporation tax of 19% would increase to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This legislative change was enacted on 10 June
2021. On 27 October 2021 it was announced that the banking surcharge would decrease from 8% to 3% also from 1 April 2023. This legislative change was enacted on 24 February 2022. The impact
of these changes on deferred tax balances has been recognised in these financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

The movements on the deferred tax account are as follows:

The majority of deferred tax assets are anticipated to be recoverable after more than one
year. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross temporary differences
for the Group of £59 million and Society of £52 million (2022: £48 million and £43 million
respectively). These differences relate primarily to revalued properties, for which capital
losses realised on disposal can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not
been recognised in respect of these items because it is not considered probable that future
taxable gains will be available against which they can be utilised.

Note:
i. Deferred tax on the Society’s retirement benefit asset is provided at 35%.

For deferred tax assets recognised on the balance sheet, the Group considers that there will be
sufficient future trading profits in excess of profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable
temporary differences to utilise the deferred tax assets.
As a result of exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there
are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.

14. Loans and advances to customers (continued)
The tables below summarise the movements in, and stage allocations of, gross loans and advances to customers held at amortised cost, including the impact of ECL impairment provisions and
excluding the fair value adjustment for micro hedged risk. The lines within the tables are an aggregation of monthly movements over the year. Residential mortgages represent the majority of the
Group’s loans and advances to customers. Additional tables summarising the movements for the Group’s residential mortgages and consumer banking are presented in the Credit risk section of the
Risk report.
The reasons for key movements shown in the table below are as follows:
The movement in gross balances is principally a result of £35,327 million of new lending, offset by a reduction of £32,314 million from repayments and redemptions. The majority of these
movements relate to residential mortgages.
Of the £143 million of write-offs, £97 million relates to consumer banking, £25 million to residential mortgages and £21 million to commercial and other lending.
Impairment provisions increased by £19 million in the period to £765 million. Further detail on the impairment provision release or charge by portfolio is shown in note 10.
Gross balance transfers between stages 1 and 2 are principally driven by residential mortgage movements. There has been a net transfer of loans from stage 1 to stage 2, primarily due to an
increased PD uplift for economic uncertainty, in addition to the implementation of models which are more responsive to the risks in the economic scenarios. This has also led to an increase in
gross movements between stages 1 and 2.

Notes:
i. Group gross balances of credit impaired loans include £123 million (2022: £135 million) of purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) loans, which are presented net of lifetime ECL on transition to IFRS9 of
£5 million (2022: £5 million).
ii. The remeasurement of provisions arising from a change in stage is reported within the stage to which the assets are transferred.
iii. If a new asset is generated in the month, the value included is the closing gross balance and provision for the month. All new business written is included in Stage 1.
iv. This comprises further lending and capital repayments where the asset is not derecognised. The value for gross balances is calculated as the closing gross balance for the month less the opening gross balance for the
month. The value for provisions is calculated as the change in exposure at default (EAD) multiplied by opening provision coverage for the month.
v. This comprises changes in risk parameters, and changes to modelling inputs and methodology. The provision movement for the change in risk parameters is calculated for assets that do not move stage in the
month.
vi. For any asset that is derecognised in the month, the value disclosed is the provision at the start of that month.

Notes:
i. The remeasurement of provisions arising from a change in stage is reported within the stage to which the assets are transferred.
ii. If a new asset is generated in the month, the value included is the closing gross balance and provision for the month. All new business written is included in stage 1.
iii. This comprises further lending and capital repayments where the asset is not derecognised. The value for gross balances is calculated as the closing gross balance for the month less the opening gross balance for the
month. The value for provisions is calculated as the change in exposure at default (EAD) multiplied by opening provision coverage for the month.
iv. This comprises changes in risk parameters, and changes to modelling inputs and methodology. The provision movement for the change in risk parameters is calculated for assets that do not move stage in the
month.
v. For any asset that is derecognised in the month, the value disclosed is the provision at the start of that month.

The maturity analysis is produced on the basis that where a loan is repayable by instalments, each such instalment is treated as a separate repayment. The analysis is based on contractual maturity
rather than actual redemption levels experienced, which are likely to be materially different.

Notes:
i. Mortgages pledged include £6.6 billion (2022: £9.7 billion) in the covered bond and securitisation programmes that are in excess of the amount contractually required to support notes in issue.
ii. Notes in issue which are held by third parties are included within debt securities in issue. Further information on debt securities is included in note 18.
iii. Notes in issue, held by the Group and drawn are whole mortgage loan pools securing amounts drawn with the BoE under the TFSME. At 4 April 2023 the Group had outstanding TFSME drawings of £17.2 billion
(2022: £21.7 billion).
iv. Notes in issue, held by the Group and undrawn, are debt securities issued by the programmes to the Society and mortgage loan pools that have been pledged to the BoE but not utilised.

Mortgages pledged under the Nationwide Covered Bond programme provide security for issues of covered bonds made by the Society. During the year ended 4 April 2023, £3.8 billion (sterling
equivalent) of notes were issued, and £2.8 billion (sterling equivalent) of notes matured.
The securitisation programme notes are issued by Silverstone Master Issuer plc and are not included in the accounts of the Society. Silverstone Master Issuer plc is fully consolidated into the
accounts of the Group. The issuance proceeds are used to purchase, for the benefit of note holders, a share of the beneficial interest in the mortgages pledged by the Society. The remaining
beneficial interest in the pledged mortgages of £3.4 billion (2022: £4.8 billion) stays with the Society and includes its required minimum seller share in accordance with the rules of the programme.
The Group is under no obligation to support losses incurred by the programme or holders of the notes and does not intend to provide such further support. The entitlement of note holders is
restricted to payment of principal and interest to the extent that the resources of the programme are sufficient to support such payment and the holders of the notes have agreed not to seek
recourse in any other form. During the year ended 4 April 2023, £0.8 billion (sterling equivalent) of notes were issued, and £1.2 billion (sterling equivalent) of notes matured or were repurchased.

14. Loans and advances to customers (continued)
The whole mortgage loan pools are pledged at the BoE Single Collateral Pool. Notes are not issued when pledging the mortgage loan pools at the BoE. Instead, the whole loan pool is pledged to the
BoE and drawings are made directly against the eligible collateral, subject to a haircut. At 4 April 2023, £23.0 billion (2022: £29.5 billion) of pledged collateral supported £17.2 billion (2022:
£21.7 billion) of TFSME drawdowns.
In accordance with accounting standards, notes in issue and held by the Group are not recognised in the Group’s or Society’s balance sheets. Mortgages pledged are not derecognised from the
Group or Society balance sheets as the Group has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group and Society continue to be exposed to the liquidity risk, interest rate risk
and credit risk of the mortgages. No gain or loss has been recognised on pledging the mortgages to the programmes.
The following table sets out the carrying value and fair value of the transferred assets and liabilities for the Silverstone Master Trust:

15. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
A variety of benchmark interest rates are used in global financial markets to calculate interest payments and fair values for derivative contracts. US dollar Libor is expected to be discontinued on 30
June 2023 with the alternative benchmark rate being the Secured overnight financing rate (Sofr). The Group is continuing its transition to alternative benchmark rates for those financial contracts
currently referencing US dollar Libor.
In respect of the Group’s hedge accounting relationships, the interest rate benchmark reform has not adversely impacted the Group’s current fair value and cash flow hedge accounting structures.
Hedge accounting documentation has been amended to reflect the changes required by the reform; these changes to the documentation have not resulted in the discontinuation of hedge
accounting or required the designation of a new hedge relationship.
At 4 April 2023, the Group had the following exposures impacted by interest rate benchmark reform which have yet to transition to the replacement benchmark rate:

Notes:
i. The Society exercised its option to call these notes during the year ended 4 April 2023.
ii. On 9 June 2022, the Society repurchased £701 million of Tier 2 eligible notes.

Senior non-preferred notes are a class of subordinated liability which rank equally with each other and behind the claims against the Society of all depositors, creditors and investing members other
than holders of Tier 2 eligible subordinated notes, permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBS), Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments and core capital deferred shares (CCDS). Senior non-preferred notes
contribute to meeting the Society’s minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and loss absorbing requirements.
The Tier 2 eligible subordinated notes rank equally with each other and ahead of claims against the Society of holders of PIBS, AT1 instruments and CCDS.
The interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from the issuance of fixed rate and foreign currency subordinated liabilities have been mitigated through the use of derivatives.

Note:
i. Repayable, at the option of the Society, in full on the initial call date or every fifth anniversary thereafter. If not repaid on a call date, then the interest rate is reset at a margin to the yield on the then prevailing fiveyear benchmark gilt rate.

All PIBS are denominated in sterling and only repayable with the prior consent of the PRA. PIBS do not form part of capital resources.
PIBS rank equally with each other. They are deferred shares of the Society and rank behind the claims against the Society of all noteholders, depositors, creditors and investing members of the
Society, other than the holders of AT1 and CCDS instruments.
The interest rate risk arising from the issuance of fixed rate PIBS has been mitigated through the use of interest rate swaps.

Note:
i. Investment securities exclude £40 million (2022: £118 million) of investment securities held at amortised cost.

The Group’s Level 1 portfolio comprises government and other highly rated securities for which traded prices are readily available. Asset valuations for Level 2 investment securities are sourced from
consensus pricing or other observable market prices. None of the Level 2 investment securities are valued using models. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities are valued using observable market
data for all significant valuation inputs. More detail on the Level 3 portfolio is provided in note 22.

21. Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value (continued)
Transfers between fair value hierarchies
Instruments move between fair value hierarchies primarily due to increases or decreases in market activity or changes to the significance of unobservable inputs to valuation, and are recognised at
the date of the event or change in circumstances which caused the transfer. There were no transfers between the Level 1 and Level 2 portfolios during the current or prior year.

22. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value – Level 3 portfolio
The main constituents of the Level 3 portfolio are as follows:
Loans and advances to customers
Certain loans and advances to customers are classified as FVTPL. Level 3 assets in this category include a closed portfolio of residential mortgages and a small number of commercial loans.
Investment securities
The Level 3 items in this category primarily include investments made in Fintech companies, of which £44 million (2022: £46 million) are equity investments which have been designated at FVOCI
as the investments are being held for long term strategic purposes.
Derivative financial instruments (inflation swaps and swaptions)
Inflation swaps are used to hedge the Group’s investments in index-linked government debt. Adjustments to the inflation curve to reflect seasonality in inflation index publications are required to
determine a valuation; however, unlike most derivative valuation inputs, this market data is not available and therefore the input is internally derived rather than observable. Where the impact of
seasonality is significant to the valuation of the swaps, these are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

22. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value – Level 3 portfolio (continued)
Discount rate
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future cash flows. The level of the discount rate takes into account the time value of money, but also the risk associated with the
investment at the time the investment was made. Typically, the greater the risk, the higher the discount rate. A higher discount rate leads to a lower valuation and vice versa.
Seasonality
An inflation swap curve is built using inflation swap quotes to forecast the UK retail price index and EU and US consumer price indices. This curve is used to calculate future cash flows. While these
instruments give a good indication of annual growth in inflation, monthly index fixings throughout the year tend to behave differently and so the inflation swap curve is adjusted for this seasonality
accordingly. The higher the seasonality, the greater the adjustment to the inflation swap curve.

Computer software capitalised during the year primarily relates to the Group’s investment in digital services, data capabilities and modernisation of the Group’s technology estate. The total cost at 4

against them. For all other computer software capitalised the estimated useful life of individual assets is predominantly 5 years.
An impairment loss of £28 million (2022: £29 million) was recognised in the year, primarily as a result of software becoming obsolete earlier than envisaged due to ongoing investment to ensure
the Group's technology estate is fit for the future.
The Society’s intangible assets are as shown above for the Group, except that they exclude £12 million (2022: £12 million) of goodwill relating to the acquisition of The Mortgage Works (UK) plc
which is only recognised at Group level. Capital expenditure contracted for but not accrued at 4 April 2023 was £10 million (2022: £25 million).

Note:
i. During the year, there has been a transfer of investment property to right-of-use branches and non-specialised administration buildings, following the decision to reoccupy the property.

Group property, plant and equipment at 4 April 2023 includes £1 million (2022: £1 million) of specialised administration buildings held by subsidiary undertakings.
Property, plant and equipment includes £14 million (2022: £18 million) of assets in the course of construction. Capital expenditure contracted for but not accrued at 4 April 2023 was £4 million
(2022: £6 million). As at 4 April 2023, branches and non-specialised buildings includes £3 million (2022: £8 million) of properties which are classified as held for sale.
An impairment loss of £29 million (2022: £25 million) was recognised in the year, due largely to decisions to vacate leased right-of-use administrative buildings and the associated write down of
capitalised improvements to these buildings.
Branches and non-specialised buildings are valued annually at the balance sheet date by independent surveyors. The current use of all branches and non-specialised buildings represents the highest
and best use, and there have been no changes to the valuation technique during the year.
IFRS 13 requires that all assets held at fair value are classified according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs in calculating those fair values. Branches and nonspecialised buildings valuations are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Branches and non-specialised buildings revalued annually would have a carrying value under the historic cost model of £58 million (2022: £67 million).

Note:
i. The net income statement release relating to customer redress is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, with the exception of £3 million release which is included in administrative expenses. The net income
statement charge relating to other provisions is included in administrative expenses, with the exception of £1 million which is included in provisions for liabilities and charges.

The Society’s provisions for liabilities and charges are the same as shown above for the Group. Whilst there is uncertainty as to the timing of the utilisation of provisions, the Group expects the
majority to have been utilised by 4 April 2025.
Customer redress
During the course of its business, the Group receives complaints from customers in relation to past sales or ongoing administration. The Group is also subject to enquiries from and discussions
with its regulators and governmental and other public bodies, including the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), on a range of matters. Consideration of customer redress matters may result in a
provision, a contingent liability or both, depending upon relevant facts and circumstances. No provision is made where it is concluded that it is not probable that a quantifiable payment will be
made; this will include circumstances where the facts are unclear or further time is required to reasonably quantify the expected payment.
At 4 April 2023, the Group holds provisions of £40 million (2022: £127 million) in respect of the potential costs of remediation and redress in relation to issues with historical quality control
procedures, past sales and administration of customer accounts, and other regulatory matters.
Other provisions
Other provisions primarily include amounts for a number of property-related provisions, severance costs and expected credit losses on irrevocable personal loan and mortgage lending
commitments.

29. Contingent liabilities
During the ordinary course of business, the Group may be subject to complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers,
investors or other third parties. The Group may also be subject to legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions which may result in, among other things, actions
being taken by governmental and regulatory authorities, increased costs being incurred in relation to remediation of systems and controls, or fines. Any such material cases are periodically
reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is not yet probable that a quantifiable payment will be made, for example because the facts are unclear or further time is required to fully assess the
merits of the case or to reasonably quantify the expected payment, no provision is made.
The Group does not disclose amounts in relation to contingent liabilities associated with such claims where the likelihood of any payment is remote or where, in the case of matters subject to active
legal proceedings, such disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the conduct of the claims.
The FCA has commenced an investigation of the Society’s compliance with UK money laundering regulations and the FCA’s rules and Principles for Businesses in an enquiry focused on aspects of
the Society’s anti-money laundering control framework. The Society is co-operating with the investigation, which is at an early stage. The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the potential
financial impact arising from this matter as it is not currently practicable to do so.
Apart from the matters disclosed, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any current complaints, threatened or actual legal proceedings, regulatory or other matters to have a material
adverse impact on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters may not
ultimately be material to the Group’s results.

30. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes in the UK – the Nationwide Group Personal Pension Plan (GPP) and the Nationwide Temporary Workers Pension Scheme. New
employees are automatically enrolled into one of these schemes. Outside of the UK, there is a defined contribution pension scheme for a small number of employees in the Isle of Man.
The Group also has funding obligations to several defined benefit pension schemes, which are administered by boards of trustees. Pension trustees are required by law to act in the interests of all
relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy of fund assets, as well as the day-to-day administration. The Group’s largest pension scheme is the Nationwide Pension Fund (the
Fund). This is a defined benefit pension scheme, with both final salary and career average revalued earnings (CARE) sections. The Fund was closed to new entrants in 2007 and since that date
employees have been able to join the GPP. The Fund was closed to future accrual on 31 March 2021.
In line with UK pensions legislation, a formal actuarial valuation (‘Triennial Valuation’) of the assets and liabilities of the Fund is carried out at least every three years by independent actuaries. During
the year, Nationwide and the Trustee completed the Fund’s 31 March 2022 Triennial Valuation, which showed a funding surplus. The main differences between the assumptions used for assessing
defined benefit liabilities for purposes of the actuarial funding valuation and those used for accounting under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ are that the financial and demographic assumptions used for
the funding valuation are generally more prudent than those used for the IAS 19 valuation. As the Triennial Valuation indicated a funding surplus, a recovery plan requiring employer deficit
contributions was not needed.
In November 2020, Nationwide and the Trustee of the Fund entered into an arrangement whereby Nationwide agreed to provide £1.7 billion of collateral (a contingent asset) in the form of selfissued Silverstone notes to provide additional security to the Fund. The Fund would have access to these notes in the case of certain events such as insolvency of Nationwide.
On 14 October 2022, the Society provided two uncollateralised loans totalling £400 million to the Fund. This temporary support allowed the Fund to manage its ongoing liquidity requirements
during a period of high market volatility. These two loan balances, including accrued interest of £4 million, were fully repaid in November 2022 and January 2023, respectively.
Further information on the Group’s obligations to defined benefit pension schemes is set out below.

Most members of the Fund can draw their pension when they reach the Fund’s retirement age of 65. The methodologies for calculating the level of pension benefits accrued before 1 April 2011
varied; however, most were based on 1/54th of final salary for each year of service. Pension benefits accrued after 1 April 2011 until 31 March 2021 were usually based on 1/60th of average earnings,
revalued to the age of retirement, for each year of service (also called CARE). From 1 April 2021, members moved from active to deferred status, with future indexation of deferred pensions before
retirement measured by reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). On the death of a Fund member, benefits may be payable in the form of a spouse/dependant’s pension, lump sum (paid within
five years of a Fund member beginning to take their pension), or refund of Fund member contributions.

30. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
Approximately 57% (2022: 68%) of the Fund’s pension obligations relate to deferred Fund members (current and former employees not yet drawing their pension) and 43% (2022: 32%) to current
pensioners and dependants. The weighted average duration of the Fund’s overall pension obligation is approximately 16 years (2022: 21 years), reflecting an average duration of 20 years for
deferred members and 12 years for current pensioners.
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations include a deficit of £1 million (2022: surplus of less than £1 million) recognised in a subsidiary company, Nationwide (Isle of Man) Limited. This obligation
relates to a defined benefit scheme providing benefits based on both final salary and CARE, which was closed to new entrants in 2009. The Group’s retirement benefit obligations also include
£4 million (2022: £7 million) in respect of unfunded legacy defined benefit arrangements.

As the Fund is closed to future accrual, there have been no current service costs, past service costs or employer contributions made in respect of future benefit accrual during the year (2022: £nil).
Additionally, there have been no employer deficit contributions required into the Fund (2022: £nil) and there are no such contributions scheduled in the year ending 4 April 2024 or future years
under the current Schedule of Contributions. Employer deficit contributions of £1 million (2022: £1 million) were made in respect of the Group’s defined benefit scheme in its Nationwide (Isle of
Man) Limited subsidiary.
The £2,144 million loss (2022: £432 million gain) relating to the return on assets (less than)/greater than the discount rate is driven by decreases in value of the Fund’s liability matching assets.
The £2,059 million actuarial gain (2022: £404 million) on defined benefit obligations is due to:
•
•
•

A £2,175 million gain (2022: £390 million) from changes in financial assumptions, driven by a 2.1% increase in the discount rate (which decreases the value of liabilities), in addition to a 0.3%
decrease in assumed Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation and a 0.3% decrease in assumed Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation (which also decreases the value of the liabilities).
A £22 million gain (2022: £73 million) arising from the impacts of updates to demographic assumptions and applying the latest industry views for projecting future longevity improvements.
An experience loss of £138 million (2022: £59 million) primarily reflecting the difference between estimates of long-term inflation compared to actual inflation.

Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations (including unfunded obligations) are as follows:

The Fund’s liabilities are well hedged by matching assets, primarily government bonds and corporate bonds. In addition, the Fund invests in alternative matching assets such as property ground
rents and property leases (included in property above) that are expected to generate inflation-linked income over the long term.
The Fund also holds return-seeking assets which are expected to generate a return over and above the Fund’s liabilities in the long term but may create risk and volatility in the short to medium
term.
During the year the Trustee has continued to manage interest rate and inflation risk in the Fund through the use of certain investments and derivative instruments to reduce volatility from changes
to long-term interest rates and inflation expectations. The increases in bond yields over the year led the Fund to increase collateral levels, supporting its liability-driven investment positions to ensure
it could withstand further increases in yields. The Fund continued to de-risk from return seeking assets by significantly reducing holdings of listed equities. The Fund’s investments also continue to
be supported by the utilisation of repurchase agreements (loans collateralised against the Fund’s government bonds), which at 4 April 2023 amounted to £786 million (2022: £1,555 million). In
January 2022 the Trustee completed a pensioner buy-in for the smaller Cheshire & Derbyshire section of the Fund, removing the investment and longevity risk to the Fund in relation to members in
this section. At 4 April 2023, the value of the insurance asset for the Cheshire & Derbyshire section buy-in was £113 million (2022: £148 million).
The investments are monitored by both the Trustee and the Society to ensure they remain appropriate given the Fund’s long-term objectives.

assumptions made are illustrated in the table above, showing how long the Group would expect the average Fund member to live for after the age of 60, based on reaching that age at 4 April 2023 or
in 20 years’ time at 4 April 2043.

Other equity instruments are Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments. The AT1 instruments rank equally to each other and are junior to claims against the Society of all depositors, creditors and
investing members, other than the holders of CCDS.
The AT1 instruments pay a fully discretionary, non-cumulative fixed rate of interest. Coupons are paid semi-annually in June and December. AT1 instruments have no maturity date but are repayable
at the option of the Society from the first reset date, and on every fifth reset date anniversary thereafter. If they are not repaid the interest rate resets at the rates shown in the table above.
If the fully loaded CET1 ratio for the Society, on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis, falls below 7% the AT1 instruments convert to CCDS instruments at the rate of one CCDS share for every
£100 of AT1 holding.
Interest payments totalling £78 million were made in the year ended 4 April 2023 (2022: £78 million), representing the maximum non-cumulative fixed coupon amounts. These payments have
been recognised in the statement of movements in member’s interest and equity. A coupon payment of £39 million is expected to be paid on 20 June 2023 and will be recognised in the statement
of movements in members’ interests and equity in the year ending 4 April 2024.

Directors’ service address
Documents may be served on any of the directors c/o Addleshaw Goddard LLP, One St Peter’s Square, Manchester M2 3DE.
Directors’ service contracts
Executive directors’ terms and conditions of employment are detailed in their individual contracts or service agreements which include a notice period of 12 months from the Society to the individual
and a notice period of six months from the individual to the Society. The notice period offered to any new recruit would be in line with this approach.
Directors’ share options
A proportion of executive directors’ variable pay is linked to the value of the Society’s core capital deferred shares (CCDS), details of which have been provided in the Report of the directors on
remuneration. For 2022/23, the executive directors participated in the Annual Performance Pay (APP) plan and the Long-Term Performance Pay (LTPP) plan. A maximum of 20% of the combined
value of the APP and LTPP awards is payable in June 2023 with an equivalent proportion retained until June 2024. A minimum of 60% of the combined value is deferred, payable between years
three and seven following the date of award. 50% of the upfront portion and 60% of the deferred portion is linked to the performance of the Society’s CCDS. These CCDS-linked elements are
payable in cash subject to a 12-month retention period. No directors held securities in Nationwide Building Society during the year.

Underlying profit, Forward-looking statement
and Glossary

Underlying profit
Profit before tax shown on a statutory and underlying basis is set out on page 70. The purpose of the underlying profit measure is to reflect management’s view of the Group’s underlying
performance and to assist with like for like comparisons of performance across periods. Underlying profit is not designed to measure sustainable levels of profitability as that potentially requires
exclusion of non-recurring items even though they are closely related to (or even a direct consequence of) the Group’s core business activities.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this document are forward-looking with respect to plans, goals and expectations relating to the future financial position, business performance and results of Nationwide.
Although Nationwide believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, Nationwide can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be an
accurate reflection of actual results. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances that are beyond the control of
Nationwide including, amongst other things, UK domestic and global economic and business conditions, market-related risks such as fluctuation in interest rates and exchange rates,
inflation/deflation, the impact of competition, changes in customer preferences, risks concerning borrower credit quality, delays in implementing proposals, the timing, impact and other
uncertainties of future acquisitions or other combinations within relevant industries, risks relating to sustainability and climate change, the policies and actions of regulatory authorities and the
impact of tax or other legislation and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which Nationwide operates. The economic outlook remains unusually uncertain and, as a result, Nationwide’s actual
future financial condition, business performance and results may differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Due to such risks
and uncertainties, Nationwide cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Nationwide undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This document does not constitute or form part of an offer of securities for sale in the United States. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption
from registration. Any public offering to be made in the United States will be made by means of a prospectus that may be obtained from Nationwide and will contain detailed information about
Nationwide and management as well as financial statements.
